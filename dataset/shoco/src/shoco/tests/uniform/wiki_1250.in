Talkin' 'bout Soul consisted of tracks recorded by Little Richard for Vee-Jay Records in 1964 and 1965. All of the songs had been released before except "You Better Stop". "Something Moves In My Heart" had previously been included on the 1971 UK released album, Mr. Big, under the title "Every Time I Think About You". This album is essentially the Mr. Big album with one extra previously unreleased track.
