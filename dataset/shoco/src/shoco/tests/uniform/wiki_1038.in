Kaya (榧, "torreya nucifera") was one of 18  Matsu-class  escort destroyers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War II. Completed in late 1944, the ship began convoy escort duties in October. She was slightly damaged by American aircraft while escorting cruisers on a bombardment mission in the Philippines during Operation Rei in December. Kaya spent the rest of the war escorting convoys and capital ships after repairs.
The ship was surrendered to the Allies at the end of the war and used to repatriate Japanese troops until 1947. Mid-year the destroyer was turned over to the Soviet Union and was commissioned that same year. She was renamed Volevoy (Волевой (Willful)) later that month. When the ship was converted into a target ship in 1949, she was renamed TsL-23. The vessel was hulked in 1958 and ordered to be scrapped the following year.
