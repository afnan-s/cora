Johnstone North, Kilbarchan, Howwood and Lochwinnoch is one of the twelve electoral wards in Renfrewshire, Scotland. It elects four of its forty-three Councillors using the Single Transferable Vote electoral system.As reflected in its name, the ward contains the northern half of the town of Johnstone (including the town centre and the Cartside neighbourhood, the division being the Inverclyde Line railway tracks) and the villages of Kilbarchan, Howwood and Lochwinnoch. Already consisting of a large rural hinterland up to the borders of North Ayrshire and Inverclyde local authorities to the west and north respectively, a boundary review in 2017 added Howwood and its rural peripheries leading to East Renfrewshire from the Johnstone South, Elderslie and Howwood ward, both entities being re-named accordingly and Johnstone North gaining one further seat.
