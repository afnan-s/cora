Corporate warfare is a form of information warfare in which attacks on companies by other companies take place. Such warfare may be part of economic warfare and cyberwarfare; but can involve espionage, 'dirty' PR tactics, or physical theft. The intention is largely to destabilise or sink the value of the opposing company for financial gain, or to steal trade secrets from them.
