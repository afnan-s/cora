The Latin-script letter Z (Russian: зэд, зи, IPA: [zɛd, zi]) is one of several symbols (including "V" and "O") painted on military vehicles of the Russian Armed Forces involved in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is speculated that the Z helps task forces distinguish themselves from other forces.Subsequently, it became a militarist symbol used in Russian propaganda and by Russian civilians as a sign of support for the invasion. Outside Russia, the symbol has been banned from public display in various countries. The "Z" symbol has been pejoratively called a zwastika or zwaztika, in reference to the Nazi swastika, or pejoratively in Russian and Ukrainian as "zig" or "zigi" (Russian: зиг, зигий) in reference to Sieg Heil.
