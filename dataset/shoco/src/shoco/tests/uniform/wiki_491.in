Li Shunxian 李舜弦 (c. 900 – 926, Sichuan) was an Iranian-born Chinese poet celebrated for her beauty and poetic talent. She was a concubine of Wang Yan (Wang Zongyan), the Chinese Emperor of Former Shu. She was famous for being a non-Chinese woman who was an accomplished poet in the Chinese language.Her Persian family had adopted the Chinese surname Li. After they fled the Huang Chao rebellion into interior China (Sichuan), they rose to prominence in the Chinese court of the Later Shu Kingdom.
It is unknown whether she had a Persian name or whether she spoke Persian. It is also unknown whether her parents were immigrants to China or were born in China.
It is believed that Shunxian's family was Zoroastrian because of one line in Shunxian's poem mentioning a "golden bullet for a catapult" which Veshparkar, an Iranian god was known to deploy. However, other scholars such as Chen Mingyuan reason that they were more likely Nestorian Christians because in China the Nestorians were known for their medicine, as Shunxian's brother Li Xu 李珣 was known to have written on. A third possibility is that following the Islamization of Persia, Shunxian's family was Muslim. Nonetheless there is no direct evidence for any of these.
