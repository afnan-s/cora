Amarna letter EA 59, titled: "From the Citizens of Tunip", is a short- to moderate-length clay tablet Amarna letter from the city-state of Tunip, written to the Pharaoh of Egypt. Only one other city sent a clay tablet Amarna letter to the Pharaoh, namely Irqata (modern Arqa), letter EA 100, titled: "The City of Irqata to the King".
The EA 59 letter concerns the "watch-guarding" of Tunip, regional warfare (with the Habiru), and the city's continued protection, and loyalty to the Egyptian Pharaoh. 
EA 59 is located at the British Museum, no BM 29824. A line drawing of tablet letter EA 59 can be viewed here: Obverse & Reverse: [1]
