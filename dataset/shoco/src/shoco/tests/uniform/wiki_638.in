Mooga Manasulu (transl.â€‰Mute Hearts) is a 1964 Indian Telugu-language drama film directed by Adurthi Subba Rao who co-wrote the film with Acharya Atreya and Mullapudi Venkata Ramana. The film stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Savitri and Jamuna, with music composed by K. V. Mahadevan. Mooga Manasulu is based on the concept of reincarnation, the first of its kind in Indian cinema in the genre of semi-fiction intended to be more serious in tone with elements that encourage a broader range of moods throughout the narrative. The film was remade in Hindi as Milan (1967) directed by Rao himself, while the Tamil Praptham (1971) was adapted from Rao's work. The Telugu version received the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu, and the Filmfare Best Film Award (Telugu) in 1964 and was screened at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.
