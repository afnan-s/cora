Henry Alford is a humorist and journalist who has written for The New Yorker magazine for more than two decades. A former columnist for The New York Times and contributing editor to Vanity Fair, he is the author of six books, including How to Live and Big Kiss, an account of his attempts to become a working actor, which won a Thurber Prize.Sometimes called an "investigative humorist," he is primarily known for his first-person quests and exploits. These include creating a gourmet meal out of food purchased at a 99-Cent Store, eating at a nude restaurant in Paris with his boyfriend, inviting a restaurant health inspector to rate his apartment's kitchen while he was serving lunch to friends, and trying to pass the National Dog Groomers Association's certification test by applying lipstick to his cocker spaniel's snout and telling the test's judge, "I like a dog with a face."His humor pieces for The New Yorker have included his imagining British taxi drivers reciting W.H. Auden's poetry to their passengers (which erroneously suggested citizens of the Northern city of York speak in the Cockney dialect)  and a playlet composed entirely of Eugene O'Neill's stage directions. (Both are collected in the New Yorker's humor anthology, Disquiet Please, and the O'Neill playlet has been taught at M.I.T.) As a result of writing a 2005 article about fake words inserted in dictionaries for copyright purposes, he has been credited with coining the word "mountweazel."He has contributed frequently to the Styles sections of the New York Times and to the New York Times Book Review, and written extensively about food and travel. His January 2013 article in the Travel section of the New York Times about Medellin, Colombia was referenced by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the Benghazi hearings.
