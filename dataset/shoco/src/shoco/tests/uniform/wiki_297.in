The Poltava Regiment (Ukrainian: Полтавський полк) was one of ten territorial-administrative subdivisions of the Cossack Hetmanate. The regiment's capital was the city of Poltava, now in Poltava Oblast of central Ukraine.
The Poltava Regiment was founded in 1648 during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. Following the signing of the Treaty of Zboriv in 1649 it consisted of 19 sotnias, and had 2970 registered cossacks. In 1775, the regiment was officially abolished, and its territory was reformed into the Little Russia Governorate.
