In 2005, the band released their second album, Never Take Friendship Personal. The band's third album, Cities, was released in 2007, and became their first album to reach the top 20 of the Billboard 200, selling 34,000 copies in its debut week.Anberlin signed with major label Universal Republic in 2007 and in 2008 released New Surrender, which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, with the first single, "Feel Good Drag", claiming No. 1 on the Alternative Songs chart, after 29 weeks in the chart. Prior to the release of their fifth studio album, Dark Is the Way, Light Is a Place, Anberlin had sold over 1,000,000 albums. Their sixth studio album Vital was released October 16, 2012, and rereleased on Big3 Records under the title Devotion a year later, October 15, 2013.
On January 16, 2014, it was announced that Anberlin would be disbanding in 2014 after recording their seventh and then-final studio album, Lowborn, on their original label, Tooth & Nail Records, and touring one last time. After performing concerts in late 2018, the group reunited to tour through 2019. In May 2020, Christian mentioned they were working on new material.
