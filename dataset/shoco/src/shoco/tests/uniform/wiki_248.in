The ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (previously known as ATP Masters Series) is an annual series of nine tennis tournaments featuring the top-ranked players on the ATP Tour. The series' events have been held in Europe and North America since the debut of ATP Tour in 1990, and also in Asia since 2009. The ATP Masters, along with the ATP Finals, constitute the most coveted trophies in men's tennis after the four majors, hence the tournaments are collectively known as the "Big Titles" (alongside the Olympics).In singles, Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most titles with 38 since the Masters Series began in 1990. By completing the set of all nine Masters singles titles in 2018, Djokovic became the first and only player to achieve the Career Golden Masters. In 2020, Djokovic completed the Career Golden Masters for the second time in his career.In doubles, the Bryan brothers (Bob and Mike) have won a record 39 doubles titles as a team. Daniel Nestor and the Bryan brothers are the only doubles players who have achieved the Career Golden Masters.
