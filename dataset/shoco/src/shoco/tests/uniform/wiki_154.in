The Three Rivers was a daily Amtrak train running between New York City and Chicago, Illinois. It operated via Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, and Akron, Ohio. The Three Rivers replaced the Broadway Limited in 1995. The route was cancelled, with the last train running on March 7, 2005, due to Amtrak's unilateral cancellation of a United States Postal Service contract on the line.Service east of Pittsburgh continues to be provided by the Pennsylvanian. Stations previously served between Pittsburgh and Hammondâ€“Whiting are bereft of passenger trains, though the Capitol Limited provides service between Pittsburgh and Chicago via Cleveland, Ohio.
