A communications receiver is a type of radio receiver used as a component of a radio communication link.   This is in contrast to a broadcast receiver which is used to receive radio broadcasts.  A communication receiver receives parts of the radio spectrum not used for broadcasting, that includes amateur, military, aircraft, marine, and other bands.   They are often used with a radio transmitter as part of a two-way radio link for shortwave radio or amateur radio communication, although they are also used for shortwave listening.
