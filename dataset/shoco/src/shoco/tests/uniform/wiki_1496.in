The World Jiu-Jitsu Championship (commonly known as Mundials) is an annual Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) tournament organised by the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF). It is regarded by some as the toughest and the most prestigious  Gi tournament in the world. The first World Jiu-Jitsu Championship known as Mundial de Jiu Jitsu took place in February 1996 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 2007 the tournament moved to the US, taking place every year since then in California.
