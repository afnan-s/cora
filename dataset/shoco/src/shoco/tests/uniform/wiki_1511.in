Jammin was an original reality television series created by SÃ­ TV that documents the attempts of six Latino bands to win a $10,000 cash prize and a Gibson sponsorship. Out of hundreds of bands that submitted entries, only the top fifteen bands, selected by online polling, advanced to the next round. A panel of expert judges then chose six semi-finalists based on their musical potential. The semi-finalists were flown to Los Angeles, where they received guidance from a series of mentors and given the chance to play live for the judges. Three finalists had the opportunity make their own music video and, finally, competed in a battle of the bands on-stage.
