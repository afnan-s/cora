The 2020–21 PGA Tour of Australasia, titled as the 2020–21 ISPS Handa PGA Tour of Australasia for sponsorship reasons, was a series of men's professional golf events played mainly in Australia. The main tournaments on the PGA Tour of Australasia are played in the southern summer, so they are split between the first and last months of the year.
The season was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with several tournaments being postponed or cancelled. In response, the tour announced that the season would be extended through to March 2021, with subsequent seasons being seasonal rather than calendar based.
