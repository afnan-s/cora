Voyeurs is the only album by Two, a musical collaboration between vocalist Rob Halford (of Judas Priest) and guitarist John 5 (of Red Square Black, Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie). Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor receives executive-producer credit, with the actual production duties being handled by Bob Marlette and Skinny Puppy's Dave Ogilvie. Voyeurs features Halford's distinctive vocals in an industrial metal context similar to other work by John 5, Reznor and Ogilvie's.
The so-called "pre-Reznor Mixes" of Voyeurs were made available as a free download at Rob Halford's official website in 2002. The download package included "Shout" and "Scream", which remain unreleased. Also included was a demo of "Silent Screams" which was later recorded for Halford's Resurrection. Though the album was unsuccessful in sales, it gained a cult following years later.
