This is a list of  Spanish words of Celtic origin.  It is further divided into words that are known (or thought) to have come from Gaulish and those that have come from an undetermined Celtic source.  Some of these words existed in Latin as loanwords from a Celtic source.  Some of these words have alternate etymologies and may also appear on a list of Spanish words from a different language.  Any form with an asterisk (*) is unattested and therefore hypothetical.
