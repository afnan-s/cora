The letter Ƥ (minuscule: ƥ), called P with hook, is a letter of the Latin alphabet based on the letter p. It is used in some alphabets of African languages such as Serer.
The minuscule ƥ was formerly used in the International Phonetic Alphabet to represent a voiceless bilabial implosive (current IPA: [ɓ̥]). It was withdrawn in 1993.
The minuscule variant resembles a lowercase thorn (þ)
