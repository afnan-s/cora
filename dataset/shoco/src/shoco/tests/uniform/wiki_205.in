A jam sandwich is usually composed of two slices of bread with jam (or jelly) in the middle. It is normally consumed at lunchtime or as a snack.  In Scotland, they are also known as pieces and jam, or jeely pieces.
If another spread is added, particularly peanut butter, it becomes a variation of the Peanut Butter and Jelly (PB&J) sandwich.
