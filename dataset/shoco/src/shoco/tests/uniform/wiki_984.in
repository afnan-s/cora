GOST 10859 (1964) is a standard of the Soviet Union which defined how to encode data on punched cards. This standard allowed a variable word size, depending on the type of data being encoded, but only uppercase characters.
These include the non-ASCII “decimal exponent symbol” ⏨. It was used to express real numbers in scientific notation. For example: 6.0221415⏨23.
The ⏨ character was also part of the ALGOL programming language specifications and was incorporated into the then German character encoding standard ALCOR.  GOST 10859 also included numerous other non-ASCII characters/symbols useful to ALGOL programmers, e.g.: ∨, ∧, ⊃, ≡, ¬, ≠, ↑, ↓, ×, ÷, ≤, ≥, °, &, ∅, compare with ALGOL operators.
