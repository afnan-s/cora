Khangchenné Sonam Gyalpo (Tibetan: ཁང་ཆེན་ནས་བསོད་ནམས་རྒྱལ་པོ, Wylie: khang-chen-nas bsod-nams rgyal-po, Lhasa dialect: [kʰɑ́ŋt͡ɕẽ́nɛ᷈ː sǿnɑ᷈m cɛ̀ːpó]; Chinese: 康濟鼐) (died 5 August 1727) was the first important representative of the noble house Gashi (Tibetan: དག་བཞི, Wylie: dga-bzhi) in Tibet. Between 1721 and 1727 he led the Tibetan cabinet (Kashag, Wylie: bka'-shag) that governed the country during the period of Qing rule of Tibet. He was eventually murdered by his peers in the cabinet, which triggered a bloody but brief civil war. The nobleman Polhané Sönam Topgyé came out as the victor and became the new ruling prince of Tibet under the Chinese protectorate.
