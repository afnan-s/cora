The Great Australian Camel Race was an Australian event held in 1988.
This event was the work of the Australian millionaire Arthur Earle, who wanted to recognise the positive impact that camels had on the development of Australia, and highlight the importance these animals had in the exploration and transport needs in the central Australian deserts.
It is said to have been the longest animal endurance race ever held.
