Cocoricó is a Brazilian children's puppet show aired on TV Cultura, which premiered on the day April 10, 1996. The character Júlio was originally derived from a Christmas special that aired in 1989 called "Banho de Aventura" on the program Rá-Tim-Bum. When Cocoricó debuted in the 90s, the program had a similar format to Glub Glub featuring short European animated series like Pingu and Fireman Sam interspersed with simple stories featuring the puppet characters, however some special episodes debuting new characters were made. The production of the show was done until 2001, when the production team started to work in Ilha Rá-Tim-Bum. With that Cocoricó had some reruns until 2003 received a soft reboot featuring new stories and without the cartoons.
