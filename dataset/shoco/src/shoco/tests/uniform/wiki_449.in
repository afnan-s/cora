The 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship, known as the 1995 FIFA/Coca-Cola World Youth Championship for sponsorship purposes, was the 10th edition of the FIFA World Youth Championship. It was held in Qatar from 13 to 28 April 1995. The tournament took place in three venues within the city of Doha. The tournament was originally going to be held in Nigeria. Due to a meningitis outbreak, however, Nigeria withdrew from hosting duties and FIFA relocated the event to Qatar.
