Each United Way works locally to raise funds and invest in improving lives in its community.In French, both in Quebec and across Canada, the organization is known as Centraide. The organization often uses the United Way and Centraide names together, recognizing the bilingual nature of the country's culture and people.
United Way Centraide Canada is the national office and has a distinct role to provide leadership, guidance and support to local United Ways across the country. Together, local United Ways and United Way Centraide Canada form the United Way Movement.
United Way Centraide's work focuses on three key strategies that create opportunities for everyone in our communities: moving people from poverty to possibility, helping kids be all they can be, and building strong and healthy communities.
