A potentially habitable exoplanet is a hypothetical type of planet that has liquid water and may support life.
As of March 2020, a total of 55 potentially habitable exoplanets have been found.
Of those, one is believed to be Sub-terran (Mars-size), 20 Terran (Earth-size) and 34 Super Terran (Super Earths). The main feature of potentially habitable exoplanets is that they have to be located in the habitable zone of their stellar systems (although life is also possible outside this zone, and estimates of the extent of the zone can also vary widely).
