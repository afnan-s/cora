The Public Prosecution Service (Portuguese: Ministério Público; lit. 'Public Ministry'; MP) is the body of the Judiciary of Portugal responsible for the public prosecution and the representation of the State before the courts. It is an hierarchic organized body, composed of magistrates and headed by the Procurador-Geral da República (attorney-general of the Republic).
Although having the word "ministry" in its name, the MP is not a ministry in the sense of government department.
