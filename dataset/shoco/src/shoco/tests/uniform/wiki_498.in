Talking blues is a form of folk music and country music. It is characterized by rhythmic speech or near-speech where the melody is free, but the rhythm is strict.
Christopher Allen Bouchillon, billed as "The Talking Comedian of the South", is credited with creating the "talking blues" form with the song "Talking Blues", recorded for Columbia Records in Atlanta in 1926, from which the style gets its name. The song was released in 1927, followed by a sequel, "New Talking Blues", in 1928. His song "Born in Hard Luck" is similar in style.
