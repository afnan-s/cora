John Lee Comstock (September 25, 1787, East Lyme, Connecticut â€“ November 21, 1858, Hartford, Connecticut) was an American surgeon and educator, who served as a surgeon in the War of 1812.Following the war, Comstock produced numerous books on science, including works on botany, chemistry, mineralogy, natural history and physiology, targeting schools and general audiences.  His books were widely used.  
In the absence of international copyright law, some of his works "borrowed" heavily from European authors such as Edward Turner (Elements of Chemistry, 1827) and Jane Marcet (Conversations on Chemistry, 1806). In the same way, Comstock's works were edited and republished in England and Prussia by others.In 1828 Comstock was issued the first patent  in the United States for the waterproofing of cloth or leather.
