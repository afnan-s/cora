Jean Victor de Constant Rebecque (22 September 1773 â€“ 12 June 1850) was a Swiss mercenary who distinguished himself in Dutch service. As chief-of-staff of the Netherlands Mobile Army he countermanded the order of the Duke of Wellington to evacuate Dutch troops from Quatre Bras on the eve of the Battle of Quatre Bras, thereby preventing Marshal Michel Ney from occupying that strategic crossroads.
