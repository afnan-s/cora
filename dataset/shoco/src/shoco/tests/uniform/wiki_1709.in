Off-Off Campus is an improvisational and sketch comedy group at the University of Chicago, and the oldest collegiate group of its kind in the United States.  It was founded in 1986 by The Second City co-founder Bernie Sahlins, who is also an alumnus of the University of Chicago.Off-Off Campus stems from a tradition of improv comedy at the University of Chicago. In the early 1950s, improv as it is known today was invented on the University of Chicago campus at the Woodlawn Tap.  In 1959, the group, called the Compass Players, went on to form The Second City.In 1986, Bernie Sahlins returned to the U of C in order to re-establish improv and sketch comedy on the south side of Chicago.  The first generation of Off-Off Campus was trained by Sahlins, and the group continues to build on the foundation he created.Pulitzer prize winner David Auburn was a member of Off-Off's second generation. Sarah Koenig, host and executive producer of the acclaimed podcast Serial, was a member of the same generation as Auburn. In addition, Tony Award-winner Greg Kotis was one of Off-Off's original members.  Tami Sagher, a member of the seventh generation, is a writer for 30 Rock. Other Off-Off Campus alumni have written for MADTV and The Onion, created You Don't Know Jack, and performed on The Second City's mainstage.
Off-Off Campus operates in accordance with the University of Chicago's quarter system. Auditions are held during the first week of each fall quarter.  New members train significantly (roughly 20 hours a week) during fall and winter quarters before becoming responsible for mainstage revues in the spring and the following fall.  During training, new members also contribute afterglows and preglows around the mainstage revue.  Winter quarter mainstage revues are inter-generational.
