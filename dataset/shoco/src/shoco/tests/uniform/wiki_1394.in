World population milestones went unnoticed until the 20th century, since there was no reliable data on global population dynamics.It is estimated that the population of the world reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It would be more than 100 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to reach three billion in 1960. Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, by some estimates, seven billion in October 2011 with other estimates being in March 2012.Old estimates put the global population at nine billion by 2037â€“2046, and ten billion by 2054-2071, with alternative scenarios ranging from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion by the 2050s and beyond, however these milestones are likely to be reached far sooner. Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and which variables are manipulated in projection calculations, especially the fertility variable. Long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the
'low scenario', to 'high scenarios' of 24.8 billion. One scenario predicts a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150, assuming fertility remains at 1995 levels.
