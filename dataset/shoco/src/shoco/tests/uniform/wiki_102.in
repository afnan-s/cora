The Lawa Railway (Dutch: Lawaspoorweg or later Landsspoorweg) was a 173-kilometre-long (107+1‚ÅÑ2 mi) single-track metre gauge railway in Suriname. It was built during the gold rush in the early 20th century, from the harbour town Paramaribo to Dam at the Sara Creek, but it was not extended to the gold fields at the Lawa River, as originally intended.
