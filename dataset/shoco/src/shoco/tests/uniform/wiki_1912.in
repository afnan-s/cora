St. Assam's is the name of two historic churches in the village of Raheny, Dublin, one a ruin in the middle of the village, one the structurally sound but no longer primary church built for the local Roman Catholic community of the area after the revival of religious rights. Both buildings lie within the area of the r√°th (ring fort) which gave the village and district its name, and which was perhaps 110 m across.
