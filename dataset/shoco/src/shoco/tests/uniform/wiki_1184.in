Roe Cobblestone Schoolhouse is a historic one room school located at Butler in Wayne County, New York.  The cobblestone building is a one-story, 28 feet long by 22 feet deep, three bay wide structure. It was built about 1820 and is constructed of irregularly shaped, multi-colored, field cobbles. It ceased to function as a school in 1932, used as a single family residence, and is now operated as a schoolhouse museum by the Butler Historical Society, which also operates the Butler Church Museum. Both museums are open on the first Saturday of the month from May through October.
The structure is among the approximately 170 surviving cobblestone buildings in Wayne County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.
