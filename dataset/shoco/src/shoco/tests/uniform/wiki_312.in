Picnic of Love is the fifth album by Anal Cunt. It was released on July 21, 1998. The album was released as a joke and a parody of love songs, as well as of the band itself. The album is characterized by the opposite of everything that the band represents. While the normal Anal Cunt album consists of 40 to 50 tracks, mainly under a minute in length, Picnic of Love contains only eleven comparably long tracks. The downtuned distorted guitars, rapid drumming and screeched vocals of other Anal Cunt albums is replaced by soft acoustic guitar and vocalist Seth Putnam singing in gentle falsetto. The most apparent change is the lyrical content: all of the songs are about inoffensive, sweet subjects as opposed to the band's more typical deliberately offensive or provocative lyrics. The Allmusic Guide review of the album incorrectly claims that each song ends tragically or violently, but none of the songs do. Although, in the latter half of the last song, "In My Heart There's a Star Named After You", Putnam starts using his signature scream.
