The governors of the states of India have similar powers and functions at the state level as those of the president of India at the central level. Governors exist in the states, while lieutenant governors exist in union territories including the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. The governor acts as the nominal head whereas the real power lies with the chief ministers of the states and his or her councils of ministers. Although, in union territories, the real power lies with the lieutenant governor or administrator, except in the NCT of Delhi and Puducherry, where the governor shares power with a council of ministers headed by a chief minister. Few or no governors are local to the state that they are appointed.
In India, a lieutenant governor is leader of a union territory. However, the rank is present only in the union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi and Puducherry (the other territories have a administrator appointed, who is usually a politician of the ruling party in the Government of India). However, the governor of Punjab serves as the administrator  of Chandigarh. Lieutenant governors do not hold the same rank as a governor of a state in the list of precedence.
The governors and lieutenant governors are appointed by the president for a term of five years.
