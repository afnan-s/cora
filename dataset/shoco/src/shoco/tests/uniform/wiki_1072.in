Lackawanna Transit Center is the main bus station and a proposed train station in Scranton, Pennsylvania, operated by the County of Lackawanna Transit System (COLTS).
Opened in 2015, the transit center features an indoor waiting area, covered bus bays, a park-and-ride lot, and pick-up/drop-off lanes. As of 2021, it is served by COLTS, Luzerne County Transportation Authority (LCTA), Amtrak Thruway, Greyhound Lines, Martz Trailways, New York Trailways, and Fullington Trailways.Located at the corner of Lackawanna and Cliff avenues in downtown Scranton, the transit center is close to Steamtown National Historic Site, the Electric City Trolley Museum, and the Marketplace at Steamtown. The site is also next to the Pocono Mainline of the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad, and is intended to accommodate proposed expansion of the bus station into an intermodal train and bus terminal with rail service to New York City.
