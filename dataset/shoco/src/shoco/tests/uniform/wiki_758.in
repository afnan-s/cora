The Folklore Museum of Edessa (Greek: Λαογραφικό Μουσείο Έδεσσας) is located in the city of in Edessa in Macedonia, Greece. It was founded twenty years ago on the initiative of the local Alexander the Great Association. It has recently passed into the hands of the Municipality of Edessa.
Following an anthropological and ethnographical study carried out by Prof. Nora Skouteri of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the museum was re-organised and opened its doors to the public again in September 1998 in a new two-storey building at 10 Megalou Alexandrou Street, donated for the purpose by the Sivenas family (Costas & Tana Sivenas).
