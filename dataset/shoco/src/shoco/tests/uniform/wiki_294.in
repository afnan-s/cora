In shogi, Tsukada Special (塚田スペシャル tsukada supesharu) is a Floating Rook variant of the Double Wing Attack shogi opening developed by professional Yasuaki Tsukada in the 1980s.The strategy is characterized by an aggressive offense at a very early stage of the game and a particular positioning of Black's rook on the 24 square after a pawn exchange initiated by Black dropping a pawn on 24.
According to Kiyokazu Katsumata, the Tsukada Special has been influential on many different openings, especially the Twisting Rook opening as well as Ranging Rook strategies.
