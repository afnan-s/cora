House of Frankenstein is a 1944 American horror film starring Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Jr. and John Carradine. The film was directed by Erle C. Kenton based on a story by Curt Siodmak, and produced by Universal Pictures. The film is about Dr. Gustav Niemann who escapes from prison and promises to create a new body for his assistant Daniel. The two murder Professor Lampini and take over his sideshow that involves the corpse of Count Dracula. After disposing of the Count, the two move on to the ruins of Castle Frankenstein where they find the body of Frankenstein's monster and Larry Talbot, the Wolf Man preserved in the castle. Niemann thaws them and promises to cure Talbot of his werewolf curse, but secretly plots to revive Frankenstein's monster instead.
The film began production with the intention to write a story involving several Universal's horror properties. Universal had initially planned a film titled Chamber of Horrors to include several other of their horror-themed characters, but this project was halted with the idea later revived as House of Frankenstein. Filming began on April 4, 1944 and concluded on May 8. It was shown in New York on December 15, 1944.
