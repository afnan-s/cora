Big Nambas (native name V'É™nen Taut) is a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken by about 1,800 people (as of 1983) in northwest Malekula, Vanuatu. Approximately nineteen villages in the Big Nambas region of the Malekula Interior use the language exclusively with no variation in dialect. It was studied in-depth over a period of about 10 years by missionary Dr. Greg. J. Fox, who published a grammar and dictionary in 1979.  A Big Nambas translation of the Holy Bible has been completed recently by Andrew Fox.
