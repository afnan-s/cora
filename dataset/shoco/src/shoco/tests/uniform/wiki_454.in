The median artery is an artery that is occasionally found in humans and other animals.
It is present in 35% of individuals born in the late 20th century. When present, it is found in the forearm, between the radial artery and ulnar artery. It runs with the median nerve and supplies the same structures as that nerve. It may be unilateral or bilateral.
It passes deep to the flexor retinaculum and may terminate at one or more of the palmar arches.
In a deep wrist laceration, such as from a suicide attempt, the median artery may be incised, risking exsanguination.
An individual who does not have a median artery appears to suffer no ill effects.
