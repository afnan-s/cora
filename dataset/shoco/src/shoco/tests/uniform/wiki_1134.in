Femm-Isation is the debut studio album by Japanese musical duo Far East Mention Mannequins, who later adapted their name into FEMM. It was released as an independent digital album on October 1, 2014 by Maximum10 and Avex Music Creative Inc. After releasing a digital EP Astroboy in April 2014, Avex announced new material from the group. The album's production was handled by several music producers and songwriters, such as Dan Book, Alexei Misoul, Leah Haywood, Daniel James, Kevin Ross, Andreas Carlsson, and Dreamlab. It also features a guest appearance from FEMM's alter-egos; the managers Honey-B and W-Trouble. Performed in English language, Femm-Isation is primarily an electronic dance album with numerous elements of pop ballad, disco, and eurodance.
Upon its release, Femm-Isation was met with generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented the commercial appeal of the songs and group, and praised the lyrical and musical delivery. However, some critics singled out some tracks that weren't good. Commercially, Femm-Isation was unsuccessful. The album failed to chart on the Japanese Oricon Albums Chart due to their policy of restricting digital sales and releases, and failed to chart on any Japanese Billboard albums charts. The album managed to chart for a sole week on the US Billboard World Albums Chart at 10.
Femm-Isation spawned thirteen promotional singles, and eight digital singles. Despite no chart positions, the singles: "Kill the DJ" and "Fxxk Boyz Get Money" achieved viral status because of the song's musical and lyrical delivery, along with its music video aesthetics. Because of this, several online figures and websites begun spreading the songs and the group virally. FEMM promoted the album on several live performances and concert gigs. In February 2016, Femm-Isation will be re-released physically as a double album with the group's subsequent release P.o.W.!/LCS (2016).
