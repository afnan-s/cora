Bartholomew Thornhill (1 January 1911 â€“ 16 October 1970), better known as Batt Thornhill, was an Irish hurler. A long-time member of the Buttevant club, he was also a four-time All-Ireland Championship winner with the Cork senior hurling team.
An All-Ireland medal winner at junior level, Thornhill was drafted onto the Cork senior team in 1939. From his debut, he quickly made the full-back position his own and made 22 championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 1944. During that time Thornhill was part of four All-Ireland Championship-winning teams as part of Cork's record-breaking four titles in-a-row between 1941 and 1944. He also secured four Munster Championships and two National League titles.
