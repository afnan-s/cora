Gandang Gabi, Vice! (lit.â€‰'Good Evening, Vice!, also known as GGV') is a Philippine late-night comedy talk show broadcast by ABS-CBN, hosted by Vice Ganda. The program premiered from May 22, 2011, and aired every Sunday from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM, on the network's Yes Weekend! block. The talk show focuses on comedic interviews and interactive segments with celebrity guests, and from time to time, also features live acts from various performers.
The program was originally intended for only one season consisting of thirteen episodes, but after the announcement of the show's planned ending on February 19, 2012, due to the enormous feedback requesting the show's renewal, it was announced that the show's supposed end was only to be the finale of the first season, and that the show will continue with a second season the following week. During early incarnations, Gandang Gabi, Vice! initially tagged as "the Trending Capital of the Philippines" due to its consistent trending on micro-social networking site Twitter.
Due to the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, replays of previous episodes of the show were aired from March 15, 2020 until the temporary shutdown of ABS-CBN. This is because of the suspension of airing live entertainment shows and taping by the network, which resulted in the postponement of the airing of the replacement show Everybody, Sing!.
