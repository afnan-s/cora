Kunisawa Shinkurō (国沢新九郎) (1848–1877) was a pioneer of Western-style painting in early Meiji Japan. Born to a retainer of the Tosa Domain, he studied in England under John Edgar Williams, before opening the Shōgidō (彰技堂) art school in 1874, upon his return to Japan. His students include Honda Kinkichirō (本多錦吉郎), Morizumi Isana (守住勇魚), Araki Kanpo (荒木寛畝) (1831~1915), and Asai Chū.
