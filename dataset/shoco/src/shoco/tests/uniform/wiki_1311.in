Melaleuca pachyphylla, commonly known as wallum bottlebrush, is a plant in the myrtle family Myrtaceae, and is endemic to near-coastal regions of New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. (Some Australian state herbaria use the name Callistemon pachyphyllus, which is still widely used in the literature). It is a medium-sized shrub with a straggling habit and red, or sometimes greenish, bottlebrush flowers in summer.
