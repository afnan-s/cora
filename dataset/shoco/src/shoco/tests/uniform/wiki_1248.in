The demands of the Punjabi nationalist movement are linguistic, cultural, economic and political rights. Baba Farid Ganjshakar is considered as the Father of Punjabi nationalism. Baba Bulleh Shah (wrote Kafis), Waris Shah (wrote Heer Ranjha) and Bhai Vir Singh (Modern Punjabi Literature) have immense contribution to Punjabi Boli. Punjabiyat (meaning Punjabi-ness) or Punjabi nationalism is the name of a cultural and language revitalization movement of the Punjabi language. It also focuses on the political, social and literary movement for preservation of Punjabi literature, Punjabi language and Punjabi culture by unity of Greater Punjab. In Pakistan, the goal of the movement is to stop the state-sponsored suppression of Punjabi in favor of Urdu, while in India the goal is to bring together the Sikh and Punjabi Hindu communities and promote the Punjabi language in regions of Northern India. Supporters in the Punjabi diaspora focus on the promotion of a shared cultural heritage.
