Neuwiedia is a genus of primitive terrestrial orchids (family Orchidaceae), comprising 9 species native to China, Southeast Asia and certain Pacific Islands.The genus is distributed in shaded habitats. Like the genus Apostasia of the same subfamily, this genus is noted for having 3 fertile stamens instead of only one as in the case of most orchids. Because of this primitive characteristic, the genus was considered by some as not being true orchids.
The genus was named by Carl Ludwig von Blume in honor of Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied (1782-1859).
These primitive orchids are hairy, tall herbs without rhizomes. They grow long, plicate leaves. They produce an unbranched, erect, terminal inflorescence bearing usually white or yellow, nodding flowers.
