Alexander Gerald Skeel (born 17 August 1995) is an English football coach and domestic violence survivor whose near-fatal abuse at the hands of his girlfriend, Jordan Worth (born 1995), attracted widespread media coverage owing to the extreme nature of the abuse. Worth controlled, beat, stabbed, starved and tortured Skeel, leaving him with severed tendons, fluid on the brain and burns. She also prevented him from receiving medical treatment for injuries she inflicted.
Worth became the first woman to be convicted of the United Kingdom's coercive control offence and in 2018 was jailed for a total of seven and half years for her crimes. She was released in January 2022 after serving half her sentence. 
Skeel has been interviewed numerous times in the media about the abuse he suffered and his story was told in a BBC Three documentary Abused By My Girlfriend which was first shown in February 2019. He is an Ambassador for domestic violence charity The ManKind Initiative.
