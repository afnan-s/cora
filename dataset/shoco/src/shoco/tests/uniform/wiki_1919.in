The John Smith's Silver Cup Stakes is a Group 3 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older.
It is run at York over a distance of 1 mile 5 furlongs and 188 yards (2,787 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July. Prior to 2016 it was run as a handicap race and before 2018 it was also open to three-year-olds. In 2018 it was upgraded to Group 3 status and restricted to four-year-olds and up as part of the European Pattern Committee's commitment to improving the race programme for stayers in Europe.
