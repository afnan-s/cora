AMOS (an acronym for "Affordable Modular Optimized Satellite") is a series of Israeli communications satellites operated by Israel-based Spacecom. All AMOS satellites were developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) using the AMOS bus satellite bus, except for AMOS-5 which was developed by ISS Reshetnev using the Ekspress bus satellite bus, and AMOS-17 which was developed by Boeing on its BSS-702.
The six AMOS satellites used five different launch vehicles: Soyuz, Zenit, Proton, Ariane and Falcon 9; and three different launch sites: Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Centre Spatial Guyanais in French Guiana, and Cape Canaveral in Florida.
