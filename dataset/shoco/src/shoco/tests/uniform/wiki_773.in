Mamma Campisi's, formerly Oldani's and commonly known as Mama's on the Hill, is a restaurant in St. Louis, Missouri, which is located on The Hill, which is the "Little Italy" in that city, and one of the premier sources of Italian Cuisine in the United States.It was founded in 1939, by Leopold Oldani, and is credited with the invention of toasted ravioli, which is considered a key example of St. Louis cuisine. It was renamed Mama Campisi's in 1982, and continued under that name until 2005, when it was closed down. It was reopened in 2006 by Lance and Andrea Ervin and it eventually became the center of an episode of Restaurant: Impossible. It was also featured on an episode of the Travel Channel's Man v. Food, hosted by Casey Webb, in December 2017.
