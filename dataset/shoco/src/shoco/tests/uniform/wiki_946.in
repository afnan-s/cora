The 2015–16 season was the 94th season of competitive association football and 79th season in the Football League played by York City Football Club, a professional football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England. Their 18th-place finish in 2014–15 meant it was their fourth successive season in League Two. The 2015–16 season ran from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016.
Russ Wilcox made six permanent summer signings, as he approached his first full season as York manager. In October 2015, Wilcox was sacked with York 21st in the table, following a nine-match run without a win. He was replaced by former Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara in November 2015. However, York never ranked higher than 22nd place under McNamara, and were relegated into the National League after finishing bottom of the 24-team 2015–16 League Two. They lost in their opening round match in the 2015–16 FA Cup, and were eliminated in the second round of the League Cup and the Northern section quarter-final of the Football League Trophy.
42 players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were 18 different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Scott Flinders missed only three of the 51 first-team matches over the season. Vadaine Oliver finished as leading scorer with 10 goals, of which seven came in league competition, one came in the FA Cup and two came in the Football League Trophy. The winner of the Clubman of the Year award, voted for by the club's supporters, was defender Dave Winfield.
