The Ponttor in Aachen, Germany, (known in the 17th and 18th centuries as the Brückenpforte or Brückenthor) is one of the two remaining gates of the original city wall of Aachen (the other being the Marschiertor). The westernmost of the north-facing gates (the other being the Sandkaultor, which no longer exists), the Ponttor was built in the 14th century and manned by soldiers and militia throughout the Free Imperial City of Aachen era. Today, the Ponttor is used by German Youth and Scout groups belonging to the German Scout Club (1945) and the German Scout Association Saint George.
