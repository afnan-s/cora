RCAF Station Parent was a Canadian early warning radar station and formed part of the Pinetree Line air defence network.  Ground was broken in 1951, and by 1954 the station was operational.  14 Aircraft Control & Warning (AC&W) Squadron was the lodger unit operating the facility.  In 1963 the station was moved to Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) operation; in 1964 it closed, as it was deemed redundant with more powerful radar stations coming online in the sector.
