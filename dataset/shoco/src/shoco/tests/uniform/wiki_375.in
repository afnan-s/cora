Desiderata is a 1971 album by Les Crane with music by Broadway composer Fred Werner and concept and various lyrics by David C. Wilson. It is a spoken word album with sung refrains and instrumental accompaniment. The title, and title track, come from the widely circulated poem "Desiderata", which at the time was in circulation as ancient wisdom and not known to be a 1927 poem by Indiana lawyer Max Ehrmann.
Crane's supporting musicians included singer Evangeline Carmichael, whose daughter, Carol Carmichael, sang the "child of the universe" refrain on the title track, with musicians keyboardist Michel Rubini, guitarist Louie Shelton, flautist Jim Horn, and two percussionists, Joe Porcaro and Emil Richards. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.
