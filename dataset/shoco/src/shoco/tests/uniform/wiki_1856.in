Hanging with Hector is an Irish television series broadcast on RTÉ One. It is presented by the Irish personality Hector Ó hEochagáin (Hector). The show centres on Ó hEochagáin's exploits as he meets a different well-known individual for each episode and spends the day "hanging out" with them, engaging in their lifestyles and partaking in their chosen pursuits in a manner deemed entertaining for the Irish television viewing public. It has been criticised for being "about as original as washing your teeth each morning".It is very similar to its more recent female equivalent Livin' with Lucy, although Ó hEochagáin, unlike Lucy Kennedy, does not actually live with the celebrities. The celebrities are largely male, with the most recent season including the chef Richard Corrigan, the former Irish rugby union international Trevor Brennan, the rugby analyst and radio presenter George Hook and, most recently, the horse trainer Aidan O'Brien. However, the female athlete Derval O'Rourke has featured in the past. The second season featured the comedian Jon Kenny (known as one half of D'Unbelievables) and snooker player Ken Doherty. The first season included the fraudulent banker-turned CEO of Galway United F.C., Nick Leeson, the footballer Niall Quinn and Ó hEochagáin's schoolboy friend and future radio partner Tommy Tiernan.
The very first episode saw Ó hEochagáin hang with his most profile figure, Bertie Ahern, who was still Taoiseach at the time the programme was filmed and aired. The episode included a business trip to Paris. The episode with the goalkeeper Shay Given took place at his home in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. It was filmed just prior to a Premiership fixture with Arsenal F.C., and Ó hEochagáin famously acquired a pair of boots belonging to Alan Shearer. The episode with the comedian Dara Ó Briain followed him as he performed three shows in one night at the Edinburgh Fringe, made a television appearance on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and visited Brands Hatch motor racing circuit to improve his driving skills. The episode with the actor Colm Meaney was filmed in Majorca where the pair went swimming and got wheel-clamped before flying out to Norway for the Haugesund Film Festival where they attended a screening of the film The Boys (and Girl) from County Clare and sing to the Scandinavian audience a rendition of "Whiskey in the Jar". Also featured were the jockey Johnny Murtagh and the comedian Deirdre O'Kane.
