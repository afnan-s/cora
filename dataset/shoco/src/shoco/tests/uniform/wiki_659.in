Since the restoration of democracy in the British Virgin Islands in 1950, only a comparatively small number of persons have
been elected to political office.  Although elections are held approximately every three or four years, the small size of the legislative body and the tendency to return incumbent politicians has resulted in a relatively small aggregate number.
Prior to the 1967 general election legislators were elected on a non-party basis. However, many persons who were elected in those early elections later went on to form, or stand for, political parties.In addition to politicians who were elected by popular mandate, various other political positions are filled by appointment. These include:

The Governor of the British Virgin Islands
The Attorney General of the British Virgin Islands
The Speaker of the House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands
Prior to 1967, certain members of the Legislative Council (as the House of Assembly was formerly named) were appointed rather than elected.
