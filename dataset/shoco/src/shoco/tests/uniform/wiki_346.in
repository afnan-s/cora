The North Oconee River Greenway Network is a system of linear parks and trail constituting a total of 8 paved miles in Athens, Georgia. It consists of a mixture of unpaved and paved multi-use trails abutting the Oconee River, some of its minor tributaries and other parks within the county. The network continues to be expanded primarily through the use of TSPLOST funding in addition to funding from Georgia Department of Transportation. The network utilizes a mixture of rail-to-trail and riparian right of ways.
