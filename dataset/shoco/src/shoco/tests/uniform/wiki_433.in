After coaching the freshman basketball team and the junior varsity baseball team at the University of Oregon, Dietz was appointed as the head basketball coach at Lewis–Clark Normal School—now Lewis–Clark State College—in May 1971, but turned down that offer a week later to take the head baseball coaching position at San Diego State.Under Dietz, the Aztecs went to the NCAA Tournament eight times (1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1990, 1991) while winning the Western Athletic Conference five times (three regular season, two tournaments) and the Mountain West twice (one regular season, one conference). In the fall of 2001, Tony Gwynn was hired to replace Dietz at San Diego State following the 2002 season.
