The 1902 Tie Cup Final was the final match to decide the winner of the Tie Cup, the 3rd. edition of the international competition organised by the Argentine and Uruguayan Associations together. The final was contested by the two same teams of the previous edition, Argentine sides Alumni and Rosario A.C., from Buenos Aires and Rosario respectively. The winner was decided after a third match, where Rosario took revenge from the previous final and beat Alumni 2–1 in extra time after the match and the playoff ended 1–1 in both cases. All the matches were played at Sociedad Sportiva Argentina in Palermo, Buenos Aires. Rosario won its first Tie Cup after being finalist in the two previous editions.
