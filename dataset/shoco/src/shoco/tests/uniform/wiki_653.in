The Sokuten class auxiliary minelayer (測天型敷設特務艇,, Sokuten-gata Fusetsu-Tokumutei) was a class of minelayers of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), serving during the 1910s and World War II. They were called the Sokuten class from their nameship. And, they were called Toshima class after the Sokuten retired. Also, by the book, the Natsushima was included to this class. This article handles the Natsushima and Sokuten class collectively, because they do not have a big difference. Their official class name was not mentioned in the IJN official documents.
