Ja'far ibn Muhammad ibn Ammar al-Burjumi (Arabic: جعفر بن محمد بن عمار البرجمي) (died 866) was a chief judge (qadi al-qudat) of the Abbasid Caliphate.
Described as a member of a family originally from Kufa, he served as judge of Wasit before being appointed to the Kufan judiciary in 849/50 as replacement to the Mihna-era qadi Ghassan ibn Muhammad al-Marwazi. In 863 or 864 he was elevated to the chief judgeship by the caliph al-Musta'in, and he held that position until his death in 866.
