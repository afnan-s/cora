Bimmer (Russian: Бумер, IPA: [ˈbumʲɪr], alternatively Romanised as Bummer or Bumer) is a 2003 Russian road movie directed by Peter Buslov, written by Peter Buslov and Denis Rodimin. The plot revolves around four friends who get into trouble with the law and flee Moscow in a black BMW (the eponymous "bimmer").
As the men drive across the Russian expanse, they encounter corruption, violence, poverty, and various situations characterizing the bleakness and challenges of small-town life in post-Soviet Russia. 
Considered to be not only an action film, but also a critique of the policies of Boris Yeltsin, Bimmer depicts the economic crisis that followed Russia's sudden transition to a free market economy, and with it, a lost generation of men who grow up in a world ruled by criminal gangs and corrupt law enforcement. 
Despite a modest budget of US$700,000, and a limited cinematic release, Bimmer became a national hit in Russia, noted both for its cinematic quality and its soundtrack. Both the film and its soundtrack have won awards, including the Golden Aries from the Russian Guild of Film Critics.
