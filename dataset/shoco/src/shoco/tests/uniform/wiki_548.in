Much The Same is a punk rock band from the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, United States.  Their style is based on the fast, melodic skate punk of the mid-to-late 1990s made popular by bands such as NOFX, Lagwagon, and No Use for a Name.
The band began in 1999 under the name Don't Look Down and changed to Much The Same in 2001 after a legal dispute with the now-defunct New Jersey band Don't Look Down.  They released Quitters Never Win on A-F Records in 2003 and Survive in 2006.
The band announced their break-up on April 23, 2007 following their first and only European tour.
They reunited for a final farewell performance on March 26, 2011 at Reggie's Rock Club in Chicago. The sold-out show featured both fan favorite songs and a few the band rarely, if ever, played live.
The band announced on March 30, 2015 that they reunited and would be working on a new album.
