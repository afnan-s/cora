Quip is a Brooklyn, New York-based startup that sells electric toothbrushes and other oral hygiene products. It was founded in February 2015 by Simon Enever and Bill May and officially launched that November. In November 2017, it raised $10 million in series A venture capital funding from prominent investors such as Demi Lovato and Sherpa Capital. A subsequent round of funding brought the company a further $40 million from Sherpa Capital in November 2018. This funding was announced shortly after Quip began selling their toothbrushes in Target stores rather than only through an online subscription. By January 2019, the company had sold over 1 million toothbrushes and gained over 1 million subscribers.
