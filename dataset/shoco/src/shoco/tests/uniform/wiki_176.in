The Evil of the Day is a novel by Thomas Sterling, published in 1955.  The book is patterned after Ben Jonson's Elizabethan comedy Volpone, and was later adapted for the stage by playwright Frederick Knott under the title of Mr. Fox of Venice.  Together, these three works formed the basis of Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1967 film The Honey Pot.
