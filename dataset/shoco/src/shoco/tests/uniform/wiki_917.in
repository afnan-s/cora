Crosstown Parkway is a 10-mile (16 km), six-lane thoroughfare running east–west in Port St. Lucie, Florida. When complete, its western terminus will be with CR 609 (Range Line Road); currently, the temporary western terminus is with Village Parkway in Tradition, approximately 2 miles west of Interstate 95 (I-95). Crosstown's eastern terminus is with US Highway 1 (US 1); however, the road continues beyond US1 as Village Green Drive. The primary intent of the construction of this road was to ease congestion on the city's only other two east–west routes through the city, Prima Vista Boulevard and the combined State Road 716 (Port St. Lucie Blvd.)/Gatlin Blvd. roadways.
