IslamInSpanish is an educational, non-profit organization that seeks to educate Latinos about Islam in the Spanish language worldwide through audiovisual media (DVDs, TV, audio CDs, radio and interactive website). It distributes materials within the United States and to Spanish-speaking countries. It was established in Houston, Texas.
In 2013 IslamInSpanish began providing khutbahs (sermons) in Spanish at two locations in the Houston area. The weekly sessions are broadcast online to the worldwide Spanish-speaking Muslim population. In 2016, IslamInSpanish opened up the first Spanish-speaking mosque in Houston. IslamInSpanish, in cooperation with the Texas Dawah Convention, organized the first National Latino Muslim Convention in December 2016.
