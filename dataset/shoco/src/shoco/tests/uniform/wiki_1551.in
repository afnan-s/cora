Francesco Rustici, called Il Rustichino (Siena, 1592 â€“ Siena, 1626) was an Italian painter active in Siena.  He worked on commissions for the local churches as well as from the Grand-Dukes of Tuscany.  In his work he shows a preference for nocturnal effects which reveals the influence of Caravaggio and his followers, the so-called Caravaggisti.
