A Regular Production Option (RPO) is a General Motors standard coding for vehicle configuration options and began in 1970. These codes are a combination of 3 alphanumeric characters and refer to a specific option or modification to the vehicle including the paint color.  Thus the specific configuration of a vehicle as it exits the factory can be described by specifying the base model and the complete list of RPO codes.  Even a vehicle with no extra-cost options will have some RPOs, as information like the engine type and exterior paint color are always specified.

Many RPO codes have been reused over the years. For example, the ZR1 performance option was available for the Corvette for the 1970, 1990 through 1995, 2009, and 2019 model years. In some cases (such as this), the RPO specifies a package with similar function (in this case performance) to previous uses of the code. For RPOs that never became notable the code may be reused for entirely dissimilar options.
In 2018, the RPO Sticker was replaced by a QR code located on the B pillar (driver's side, between front and rear doors). While fairly complete it does not contain every RPO that is on the vehicle.
