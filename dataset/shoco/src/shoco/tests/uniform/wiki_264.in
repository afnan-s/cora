Sunandarama Maha Vihara, also known as Maha pansala is located in the southern part of Sri Lanka. It is situated 65 kilometers north of Colombo, 36 kilometers south of Galle and 200 meters east from Ambalangoda railway station. This sacred place holds a land of nearly 5 acres.
Traditionally this "Vihara" belongs to "Vilegoda", "Nambimulla", "Maha Ambalangoda" and "Paniyanduwa" which are known as "Sathara peruwa" (the four states which are benefited by the Vihara). Since early days these states have been provided the support to maintain the Vihara. Early before this place became a vicar, it was known that "Ganninanselaya" stayed here.
Sunandarama Vihara has been interred in two stories which are known as "Maluwa". The sermon hall, ("Dharmashalawa"), monastery ("Awasa"), saīmaāgaeya and alms hall ("Dhana shalawa") are situated in the lower tier while the "Vihara", "Sacred Bodhi" and "Statue house" are located on the upper. The Sacred Bodhi is a shrine in this Vihara.
