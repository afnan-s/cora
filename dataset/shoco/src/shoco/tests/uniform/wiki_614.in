"Next Plane to London" is the debut single by the American folk rock band, The Rose Garden. The single, released by Atco Records, became the band's only Top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 when it peaked at number 17. It would later reappear on the group's 1968 studio album, The Rose Garden. "Next Plane to London" made The Rose Garden one of the most memorable one-hit wonders of the late sixties, yet the song has never been recorded by another prominent group, apart from an unreleased demo by the band They Might Be Giants.
