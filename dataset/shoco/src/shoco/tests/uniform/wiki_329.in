Clivages is the ninth studio album by Belgian RIO band Univers Zero.  Only four of the ten tracks were composed by Daniel Denis, who composed a majority of the material on most previous releases .  The opening track, Les Kobolds, incorporates Flemish folk music for the first time in a Univers Zero piece.
