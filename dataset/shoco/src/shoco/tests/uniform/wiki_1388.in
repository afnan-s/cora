Bishop Wilton Wold is the highest point of the Yorkshire Wolds in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. The summit, known as Garrowby Hill, lies about five miles (eight kilometres) north of Pocklington.
As with most of the wolds, it is wide, flat and agricultural in nature. The A166 road passes right by the top. However it is a Marilyn (having topographic prominence of at least 150 m or 492 ft 2 in). There is a trig point, two covered reservoirs and an aerial.
The British artist David Hockney painted the view from the summit in 1998.
