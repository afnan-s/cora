Christ Church Mission, also known as the Anvik Mission, is a historic Episcopal church mission in Anvik, Alaska.  It is located near the former confluence of the Anvik and Yukon Rivers, about 2 miles (3.2 km) below the present confluence.  There are four buildings that survive from what was once a larger complex.  The largest is the main mission building, is a 36-by-72-foot (11 m Ã— 22 m) structure built in 1932.  The oldest building is the church, which was built in 1892, and was moved to the present site when river erosion threatened the previous one.The mission site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
