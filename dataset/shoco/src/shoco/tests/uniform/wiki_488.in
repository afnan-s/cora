Almost Grown is an American drama television series about a couple (played by Tim Daly and Eve Gordon), whose lives are explored during three time periods of their lives. The series was well received by critics, but aired for only 9 out of 13 episodes from November 27, 1988 until February 20, 1989 on CBS due to low ratings (it was placed in the same timeslot as Monday Night Football and The NBC Monday Movie).
The series was co-created by David Chase.
