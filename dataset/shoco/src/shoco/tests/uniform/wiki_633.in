Messengers were a Scottish new wave duo consisting of Danny Mitchell (keyboards and programming) and Colin King (vocals and percussion). The duo were originally part of Modern Man, a Glasgow post-punk/new wave band discovered by Midge Ure of Ultravox. Modern Man disbanded after releasing one album produced by Ure, Concrete Scheme (1980), after which Ure stayed as producer with Mitchell and King as Messengers.Messengers toured as support band to Ultravox, contributing to the live album Monument (1982), and with Mitchell co-writing Midge Ure's "If I Was". Enough material for an album was recorded by 1984, but Ure's label Chrysalis declined to release an album after offering a three singles deal only.
An album was finally released in November 2004 when Mitchell and King re-recorded many of their songs, written during the period of 1979 and 1985, for release via the official Ultravox website.  Of the thirteen tracks released on the album, only three were new compositions: "(Did) You Take Me For A Ride", "Send That Letter Home" and "The Reformation Waltz".
