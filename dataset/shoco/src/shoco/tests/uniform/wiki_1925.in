Owned by Gray Television, it maintained studios on Millwood Avenue and US 50 in Winchester, separate from its parent's studios in Harrisonburg.
The channel was available on Comcast Xfinity channel 3 in Frederick, Clarke and Warren counties and ShenTel Cable channel 101 in Shenandoah County, and on UHF channels 49.3 (PSIP 3.3) in the Harrisonburg area via the main WHSV transmitter.  From 2010 until its 2013 shutdown, it was also available in the northern Shenandoah Valley on UHF channel 42.3 via a translator station on Signal Knob near Strasburg.  It was never available on cable in the immediate Harrisonburg market.
