Unifor Local 444 is an amalgamated local union affiliated to the general trade union Unifor. Founded in 1942 as the Chrysler Division of UAW Local 195, Local 444 became a stand-alone union (then affiliated with the U.S.-based United Auto Workers) in 1956. Following the separation of the Canadian Auto Workers from UAW, the union renamed to CAW Local 444. In 2013, the Canadian Auto Workers union and the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers union merged to form a new union call Unifor.
Based in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, Unifor Local 444 represents around 4600 Chrysler Canada employees who work at the company's Windsor assembly plant, as well as a number of other Windsor-area employers including Caesars Windsor casino, Dakkota Integrated Systems, Windsor Machine Group, HBPO Canada, Integram Seating (Magna International), Johnson Controls, Oakley Sub Assembly Windsor, Presteve and Etna Foods, TransAlta Energy and TRW Automotive.
