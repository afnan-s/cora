Visaginas Nuclear Power Plant was a planned nuclear power plant project in Lithuania. It was proposed to be built at the site of the closed Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, which was shut down on 31 December 2009 in accordance with Lithuania's accession agreement to the European Union. The two reactors of the Ignalina plant are currently undergoing a decommissioning process.
After a 2012 referendum found that 62.7% of the electorate was against the project, Belarus started construction of the Belarusian nuclear power plant, which will lie geographically very close to Visaginas. According to the instigator of the Visaginas proposal, former energy minister Arvydas Sekmokas, the Visaginas Nuclear Power Plant proposal is "dead".
