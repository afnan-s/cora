The former Trinity Episcopal Church is located on NY 23B in Claverack, New York, United States. It is a Shingle Style church building from the early 20th century.
It replaced the church's second building, destroyed by fire, which had itself been a replacement for another fire-destroyed building. In 1975 the church moved out and sold it. Changes were made to convert it into a residence but it retains its historic integrity. In 1997 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
