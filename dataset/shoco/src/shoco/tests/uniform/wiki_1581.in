Fedor Fedorovich Linde (Russian: Фёдор Линде; German: Friedrich Linde; 9 February 1881 – 21 August 1917) was a Russian revolutionary and political commissar. He played an "unsung but crucial role" in turning the tide of the February Revolution, in the words of historian Orlando Figes.He was a sergeant in the Finland Regiment. For his role in leading a demonstration against Pavel Milyukov, he was sent as a commissar to the Russian Army on the front by the Soviet. Here he became well known for convincing revolutionary units to continue fighting.
Linde was killed trying to convince a group of soldiers to return to combat near Lutsk in 1917, and was hailed as a "fallen fighter of the people's cause", receiving a hero's funeral.
