Makobo Modjadji VI (Makobo Caroline Modjadji; 1978 â€“ 12 June 2005) was the sixth in a line of the Balobedu tribe's Rain Queens. It is believed that Makobo Modjadji had the ability to control the clouds and rivers. Makobo was crowned on 16 April 2003 at the age of 25, after the death of her predecessor and grandmother, Queen Mokope Modjadji. This made her the youngest Queen in the history of the Balobedu tribe. It is still argued who will be her successor, but it's thought her son will be the first Rain King in 200 years.
