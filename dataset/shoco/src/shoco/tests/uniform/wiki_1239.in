"Solanin" (ソラニン, Soranin) is a song by Japanese rock band, Asian Kung-Fu Generation. It was released as a single on March 31, 2010. The song was written for the film of the same name. The music was composed by band member Masafumi Gotoh, while the lyrics was written by Inio Asano, creator of the manga of the same name that the film is based on. Asian Kung-Fu Generation's recording was not used in the film. Instead, a cover, credited to Rotti, a fictional band from the film, with vocals by Aoi Miyazaki, who plays Meiko in the film, was used.
The single's B-side, "Mustang (mix for Meiko)" is a remix of "Mustang" from the band's 2008 EP Mada Minu Ashita ni. The song, which was also inspired by the manga, was used as the ending theme of the film. "Solanin" was included as an "extra track" on their sixth studio album, Magic Disk, and "Mustang (mix for Meiko)" is included in the band's compilation album Feedback File 2.
