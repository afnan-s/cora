Magnolia × brooklynensis is a hybrid Magnolia that is the result of a cross between Magnolia acuminata (cucumbertree) and Magnolia liliiflora (Mulan magnolia). It was developed in a breeding program at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden beginning in 1953 to create yellow-flowered varieties. 
A number of cultivars of Magnolia × brooklynensis are commercially available, including 'Evamaria',  'Hattie Carthan', and 'Yellow Bird' (the result of a back-cross with 'Evamaria' and M. acuminata var. subcordata). 'Evamaria' has purplish flowers with touches of orange, yellow or green.  'Hattie Carthan' has yellow flowers with a blush of red-purple veins, and 'Yellow Bird' has deep yellow petals. 
The Brooklyn Botanic Garden also created the 'Elizabeth' cultivar, which is often lumped in with M. × brooklynensis, by crossing Magnolia acuminata and Magnolia denudata. The cream to pale yellow flowered Magnolia 'Elizabeth' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
