Casanova is a 1918 Hungarian film directed by Alfréd Deésy and starring Deesy in the title role. For years, this film was listed in reference books as a Bela Lugosi film, since originally Star Films advertised that Lugosi was set to play Casanova. He was replaced however at the last minute by the director Alfred Deesy, who decided to play the role himself. If indeed Lugosi shot any scenes for this film, they did not wind up in the finished product. The film nevertheless still turns up occasionally in Lugosi's filmography. Perhaps this is due to the fact that Lugosi played Casanova previously on the Hungarian stage.
