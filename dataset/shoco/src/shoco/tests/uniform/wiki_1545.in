Tectonic forces have been shown to have major influences on alluvial fans. Tectonic movements such as tectonic uplift are driving factors in determining the development, shape, structure, size, location, and thickness of alluvial fans and influence the formation of segmented fans. By understanding the tectonic influences, the geologic history (the story of how the area was formed) can be determined by taking information from an alluvial fan and determining the tectonic history of the region.
