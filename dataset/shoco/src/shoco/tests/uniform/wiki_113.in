H3K36me is an epigenetic modification to the DNA packaging protein Histone H3, specifically, the mono-methylation at the 36th lysine residue of the histone H3 protein.
There are diverse modifications at H3K36, such as phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitylation, which have many important biological processes. The methylation of H3K36 has particularly had effects in transcriptional repression, alternative splicing, dosage compensation, DNA replication and repair, DNA methylation, and the transmission of the memory of gene expression from parents to offspring during development.
