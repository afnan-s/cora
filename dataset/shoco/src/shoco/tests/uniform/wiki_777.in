James Daniel Ross (28 March 1866 â€“ 12 June 1902) was a Scottish footballer who played as an inside forward.
Born in Edinburgh, in the beginning of his career Ross played for Edinburgh's St Bernard's; he came to prominence as part of the Preston North End team known as "The Invincibles", who won the Football League during its first and second seasons, the first one being a double of the league and the FA Cup.
Nicknamed the "Little Demon", Ross's older brother Nick was also a footballer.
