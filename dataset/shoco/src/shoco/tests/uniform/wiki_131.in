In 2006, the race was run at 7.5 furlongs. 2009 will be its twelfth running.
In addition to the $100,000 purse, the event offers up to $10,000 in bonus money for eligible Ontario-bred horses as well as up to $15,150 Ontario Sired/Ontario Bred Breeder Awards.
The race is named for Windfields Farm stallion, Silver Deputy.
