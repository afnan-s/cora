Arthur C. Gossard is a professor of materials and electrical engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1982, he co-discovered the fractional quantum Hall effect. His research is related to molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). He has a doctorate in physics from UC Berkeley. After university, he joined Bell Labs. 
In 1987, he was elected a member of the US National Academy of Engineering for contributions to the study of the physics of ultra-thin semiconducting layers through molecular beam epitaxy, leading to new physics and new devices. He is also a member of the US National Academy of Sciences.
In 2016, Gossard was named as a recipient of a National Medal of Technology and Innovation.
