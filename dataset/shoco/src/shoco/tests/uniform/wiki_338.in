The New American Poetry Prize is an annual prize awarded by New American Press. The award was established in 2010 to give voice to emerging writers of innovative poetry. Judges rotate annually, and have included David Kirby, Jilian Weise, and Andrew Hudgins.
The New American Poetry Prize is awarded annually to one winner for a book-length work of poetry. Authors of winning manuscripts receive a cash award of US$1000 and 25 contributor copies, and their collections are subsequently published under a standard contract.
