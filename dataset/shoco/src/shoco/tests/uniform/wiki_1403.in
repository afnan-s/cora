Takydromus sexlineatus, the Asian grass lizard, six-striped long-tailed grass lizard, or long-tailed grass lizard, is an arboreal, diurnal species of lizard. The tail length is usually over three times the body (snout to vent) length in this species.Males and females are similar, males being distinguishable by the presence of pre-anal pores. On average they grow to around 12 cm (4.7 in) snout-to-vent length, with the addition of a distinctive, prehensile long tail. Some individuals may have small circular spots on the sides of the bodies. This species of lizard is often kept as a pet.
Like geckos they can drop their tail and grow a new one when attacked.
