Ahmet Daca (died 1945), known also as Ahmet Aga was a Yugoslav Albanian political figure of Sandžak region during World War II.
Daca was from Novi Pazar. He was the brother-in-law of  Aćif Hadžiahmetović (Blyta), the main political figure of Sandžak during those times. With the involvement of Hadžiahmetović in the Second League of Prizren, Daca took over as president of the Novi Pazar municipality and district mayor, operating under the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia.By the end of World War II, with the Yugoslav partisans liberating the region, he was arrested among many Muslim and Albanian collaborationist leaders and militiamen. Daca was executed publicly together with Hadžiahmetović on 21 January 1945, in Hadžet near Novi Pazar. The three sons of his were killed in a mass execution the same day.
He is officially considered a traitor and enemy of the people. Lately, Muslim politicians have made attempts to have him rehabilitated.
