PlayOn is a streaming media brand and software suite that enables users to view and record videos from numerous online content providers. The suite consists of two main products: PlayOn Cloud and PlayOn Desktop. PlayOn Cloud is an online service for recording digital video streams, accessible via native iOS or Android mobile device applications. PlayOn Desktop is Windows-based software that acts as a streaming dashboard and hub on the PC. The available streaming websites are organized as channels in both products. Users browse through or search the video content found in those channels in order to record the videos for later viewing. PlayOn Desktop allows watching the videos real-time on the PC, or casting the videos to a TV via a streaming device or gaming console.
The recording feature of PlayOn acts as a DVR for streaming videos, creating an MPEG-4 file which can be transferred to supported media devices. Users are then able to watch these videos without necessitating access to the Internet. The recording functionality inserts chapter marks at the locations of advertisements, allowing users to automatically skip commercials when watching via a native companion applications, directly in the PlayOn Desktop player on a PC, or via a variety of other DLNA-compliant media devices.
