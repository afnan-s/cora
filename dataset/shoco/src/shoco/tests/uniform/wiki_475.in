Sonic Bloom is a 2013 solar-powered sculpture by Dan Corson, installed in Seattle's Pacific Science Center, in the U.S. state of Washington. Bellamy Pailthorp wrote, "It looks a bit like something you might find in a book by Dr. Seuss: five huge sculpted sunflowers with striped green and orange stems."
