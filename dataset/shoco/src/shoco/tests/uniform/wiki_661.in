Bread and salt is a welcome greeting ceremony in some Slavic, Nordic, Baltic, Balkan and other European cultures as well as in Middle Eastern cultures. It is also shared with some non-Slavic nations — Lithuanians, Latvians (both Baltic), Romanians (Romance) as well as some Finno-Ugric peoples like the Karelians — all of which are culturally and historically close to their Slavic neighbours. It remains common in Albania, Armenia, and among the Jewish diaspora. This tradition has also been observed in spaceflight.
