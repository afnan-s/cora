To Bonnie from Delaney is the fourth album by Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. It was their first studio album for the Atco/Atlantic label (catalog no. SD 33-341), and their fourth album overall. Coincidentally, Atco/Atlantic's parent company purchased the Bramletts' previous label Elektra Records around this time.
The album peaked at #58 on the Billboard album chart in October 1970, with a single from the album released around that same time, "Soul Shake", also charting. Several of the album's songs ("Living on the Open Road", "The Love of My Man", "Alone Together" and "Going Down the Road Feeling Bad") became staples of Delaney and Bonnie's live shows and remained so until their breakup in 1972.
"Friends" on the album includes Duane Allman, Little Richard, King Curtis and Sneaky Pete Kleinow.
