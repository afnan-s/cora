The 1994 Penn State Nittany Lions football team represented the Pennsylvania State University in the 1994 NCAA Division I-A football season. The team was coached by Joe Paterno and played its home games in Beaver Stadium in University Park, Pennsylvania.  Recently, some commentators have opined that perhaps this team should have earned a share of the 1994 national championship.
The team was selected national champion by DeVold, Eck Ratings System, Matthews Grid Ratings, and The New York Times, while named co-champion by Rothman (FACT), National Championship Foundation, and Sagarin Ratings.
