J. Howard Langley (1867 â€“ 1935) was a justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court for less than one month from January, 1931 until February 2, 1931. His term was truncated by health problems that he blamed on the rigors of campaigning for the office. Born and educated in Missouri, Langley moved to Indian Territory in 1891, where he entered the mercantile business. He became licensed to practice law in 1897, and moved to the town of Pryor to begin private practice. He was elected a delegate to the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention in 1905, where he gained much public exposure. After statehood, he returned to his private practice in Pryor, until he entered the race for a Supreme Court seat in 1930. Although he won the election, he served less than a month before resigning on account of ill health. After recovering, at least partially, he was named to the board of directors for the Grand River dam project and was elected chairman. He did not live to see the project completed, dying in 1935.
