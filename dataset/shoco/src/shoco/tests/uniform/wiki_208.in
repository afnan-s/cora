Mary Joe Frug (1941â€“April 4, 1991) was a professor at New England Law Boston from 1981 to 1991. She is considered a forerunner of legal postmodern feminist theory, and was a renowned postmodernist and feminist legal scholar.  Much of her work was collected in the posthumously-published book Postmodern Legal Feminism. She authored the casebook Women and the Law.
On April 4, 1991, Frug was murdered on the streets of Cambridge, Massachusetts, near the home that she shared with her husband, Harvard Law professor Gerald Frug, and their two children. The murder remains unsolved.
