"Kiss the Bride" is a song by English musician Elton John, from his 17th studio album, Too Low for Zero released as the third single of the album. Written by John and Bernie Taupin, the up-beat song was a top 40 hit in many countries.
In 2021, it was included on a mashup song called "Cold Heart (Pnau remix)" that became an instant hit worldwide for Dua Lipa and Elton John, and created a revival in interest in John's music. The mashup song was made by the Australian dance trio Pnau using lyrics from four different Elton John songs including "Kiss the Bride", "Rocket Man", "Sacrifice" and "Where's the Shoorah?".
John played this song on setlists from 1983 until the 1989 leg of his Sleeping with the Past Tour. The music video of the song was directed by the rock duo Godley & Creme, formerly of the art rock group 10cc.
