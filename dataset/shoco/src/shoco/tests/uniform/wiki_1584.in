Public domain music is music to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply. There are several ways that a piece of music can be in the public domain:

If all rights in it have failed, as is the case for old pieces of music such as George Gershwin's 1924 composition Rhapsody in Blue.
If the rights-holders have placed it into the public domain, for example through copyright abandonment or the Creative Commons Zero dedication.
If no rights ever applied to the music, possibly because the music predates the existence of intellectual property, as is the case for most folk music, or because it is otherwise ineligible for protection, as is the case for music performed by the various ensembles of the US military.If a piece of music does not fall within the public domain and is instead under copyright protection, most countries' laws forbid the reproduction, public performance, distribution, and creation of derivative works without the permission of the copyright holder. Under compulsory licensing laws, some of these actions may in fact be lawful, but the infringing party would then be liable to pay royalties to the copyright holder for the use of their work.
