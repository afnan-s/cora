Woolbridge Manor is a 17th-century manor house in East Stoke, just outside the village of Wool, in Dorset, England. English Heritage have designated it a Grade II* listed building. It is on the north side of the old Wool bridge, a historic crossing point over the River Frome, now closed to traffic except pedestrians and cyclists due to a bypass and junction.
