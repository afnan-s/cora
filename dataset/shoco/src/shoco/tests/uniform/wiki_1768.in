The Timberlake Expedition was an excursion into the Overhill Cherokee lands west of the Appalachian Mountains, which took place in 1761 following the Anglo-Cherokee War.  Its purpose was to renew and solidify friendship between Colonial Americans and the Cherokee People following the three-year war.  The endeavor is named after the commander of the expedition, Henry Timberlake.
