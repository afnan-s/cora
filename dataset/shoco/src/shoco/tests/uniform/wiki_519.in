Ngalifourou (1864 – 8 June 1956) was a queen of the Mbé region in what is today the Republic of Congo(Congo-Brazzaville). As a ruler she was close to French colonial authorities and was the first ruler in her region to sign a treaty with them. An important spiritual figure, as well as a royal one, her funeral was used as a tool by the French regime to try and resist its decline.
