The 1998 New York Yankees season was the 96th season for the Yankees. The team finished with a franchise record regular-season standing of 114â€“48. These Yankees set an American League record for wins in a season, a record that would stand until 2001, when the Seattle Mariners won 116 games in the regular season against 46 losses (the Yankees still hold the record for most regular season wins by a team that won the World Series). New York was managed by Joe Torre. The Yankees played at Yankee Stadium, in which they celebrated the stadium's 75th Anniversary.
In the postseason, they swept the Texas Rangers in the American League Division Series, won the American League pennant by beating the Cleveland Indians four games to two in the American League Championship Series, and swept the San Diego Padres to capture their 24th World Series. Including the playoffs, the 1998 Yankees won a total of 125 games against 50 losses, an MLB record. In rankings in 2014 and 2016, they were considered to be the fourth or fifth greatest team in baseball history.
