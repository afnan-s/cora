The Streamer bass is a bass guitar manufactured by the Warwick company and launched in 1982.The headstock design was changed around 1985 to be replaced with the current style headstock, and the original one piece bridge was later changed to the two piece style seen in current Warwick basses. Since the 1990s, Streamer basses have used MEC pickups and electronics (on certain models, most often on Limited and Special Edition series, Seymour Duncan and Bartolinis are used).
