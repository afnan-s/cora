Ibtada (Urdu for 'the beginning') is a not-for-profit, non-governmental development organisation headquartered in Alwar, India working in the Mewat region of Rajasthan. It is a small endeavor to mainstream the deprived women of this region by organizing, educating and empowering them. It was founded in 1997 by Rajesh Singhi after he conducted the Benchmark Survey of Mewat for the Government of Rajasthan.
Ibtada works in about 400 villages in 6 Blocks of Alwar, Rajasthan. This is the most backward region of Mewat and is dominated by Meo-Muslims, the traditional peasantry class. Though converted to Islam 14th century onwards, the Meos still practice many Hindu customs and traditions. The region suffers extreme social and economic backwardness due to lack of resources, awareness, education, health and on account of poor gender status.
