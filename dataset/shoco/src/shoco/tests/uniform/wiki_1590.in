Parliamentary elections were held in Angola on 9 December 1986. They had been scheduled for 1983, but were postponed due to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola's (UNITA) military gains in the civil war. The elections were the second elections conducted in the nation after in got independence from Portugal in 1975 and after the 1980 elections. During the period of 1975 to 1980, a civil war was fought between three parties, namely, People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA),  and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the disturbance continued to the 90s.
At the time, the country was a one-party state, with the MPLA as the sole legal party. As a result, most candidates were members of the party, and two-thirds were re-nominated from 1980 elections. The MPLA won 173 out of the 289 seats, while there were 116 non-party members and one seat remained vacant. The elected assemblies took the oath on 30 January 1987 and Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos took the oath as the second elected President of Angola.
