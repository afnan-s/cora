John McMurdo (1743â€“1803) was a friend of Robert Burns who became the chamberlain to the Duke of Queensberry at Drumlanrig Castle where the poet was a frequent visitor. His eldest daughter Jean (1777-1839) was also a close friend of Burns, who wrote the song "Bonie Jean" in her honour. As an old Nithsdale family the McMurdo's were related to the Sharpes of Hoddam, the Charteris of Amisfield, the Fergusson's of Craigdarroch, Dr James Currie and the Duncans of Torthorwald amongst others.
