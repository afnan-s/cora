The Sierra Leone women's national football team represents Sierra Leone in international women's football. It is governed by the Sierra Leone Football Association, which is part of the Confederation of African Football. Sierra Leone has played only four FIFA recognised matches, two in 1994 and two in 2010. The country has under-17 and under-20 women's national sides. The development of women's football in Sierra Leone faces challenges present throughout the continent. Domestically, it faces its own issues including the lack of a women's domestic competition and the decline in popularity of the sport among women.
