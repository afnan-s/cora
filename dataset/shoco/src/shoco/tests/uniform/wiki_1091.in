The Abarth 3000 Sport Prototipo was a sports car prototype made by Abarth & C. in Turin, Italy. It was the first Abarth with an engine with a capacity of more than 2-liters, after an already finished 6-liter twelve-cylinder from 1967 had become useless before it could be used due to a change in the regulations. The displacement for sports car prototypes was limited to 3 liters and for sports cars to 5 liters.
