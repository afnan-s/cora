The Cinekid Festival is the largest international film, television and new media festival for children aged 4 to 14 held at the Westergasfabriek in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It started as a small children's film festival and has now grown into a large organisation that develops activities for children in the areas of film, television and new media throughout the year. These activities are presented alongside the festival, whereas the festival itself screens films from all over the world and a selection of the best television programs for children. It also organises several new media activities. Each year the festival is attended by over 50,000 children, parents and (international) guests.
