The 1934–35 season was Port Vale's 29th season of football in the English Football League, and their fifth successive season (28th overall) in the Second Division. A positive start to the season raised hope of promotion; however, from October onwards the club performed so poorly as to finish fifth-from-bottom. One event of note was a six-week discussion over a possible change of name; the names Stoke Central, Stoke United, Stoke North End, and Hanley Port Vale were considered – however none of these names attracted enough support to institute a change.
