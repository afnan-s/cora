The gens Cilnia was an Etruscan family at ancient Rome, from the late Republic into imperial times.  This gens is best known from Gaius Cilnius Maecenas, a trusted friend and advisor of Augustus, who was famous for his immense wealth and patronage of the arts.  At least two of the Cilnii obtained the consulship under the Empire.
