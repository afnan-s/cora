Bhai Trilochan Singh Panesar also known as Veerji (18 November 1937 â€“ 19 March 2010) was a social worker in India. He is famously known as Jhaaroo (broom) Wale Veerji as he made it his mission to clean all the major historical Gurdwaras in Delhi. He organised his team of volunteers to prepare food whole day and feed thousands of people through Langar (community kitchen) every morning, in front of Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib, Chandni Chowk, Delhi.
Veerji was born in Mandalay, Burma on 18 November 1937. His father Sadhoo Singh served in the British Indian Army during World War II and later in the Indian Railways. Singh retired as a technical officer with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, New Delhi. He died on 19 March 2010. His wife was Sardarni Dalip Kaur. She died on 5 Mar 2008. The couple had two sons, Premjit Singh Panesar and Kamaljeet Singh, who are now continuing the mission started by their parents. Veerji was deeply influenced by the teachings of Sikh Gurus, Bhai Kanhaiya, and Mother Teresa.
