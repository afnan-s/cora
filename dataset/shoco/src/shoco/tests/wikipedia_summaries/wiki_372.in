Income taxes are the most significant form of taxation in Australia, and collected by the federal government through the Australian Taxation Office. Australian GST revenue is collected by the Federal government, and then paid to the states under a distribution formula determined by the Commonwealth Grants Commission.
Australia maintains a relatively low tax burden in comparison with other wealthy, developed nations, at 27.8% of GDP in 2018.
