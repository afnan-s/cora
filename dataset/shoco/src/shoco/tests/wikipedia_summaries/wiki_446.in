Williams won the high break prize of £1,000.Steve Davis won his third Classic title beating fellow Londoner Tony Meo by 9–8. Meo led 4–2 before Davis won the last frame of the afternoon session with a break of 122 and then four more frames in a row in the evening to lead 7–4. Meo then won the next four frames to lead 8–7 before Davis levelled the match at 8–8 with a break of 84. With only the colours left in the deciding frame and Meo lined up on the yellow, a spectator yelled out "Come on, Tony!". Although Meo took time to compose himself after the shout, he missed the yellow and a few shots later Davis the frame after potting the final pink.
