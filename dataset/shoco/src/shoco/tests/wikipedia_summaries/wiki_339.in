In the United States, forest cover by state and territory is estimated from tree-attributes using the basic statistics reported by the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the Forest Service. Tree volumes and weights are not directly measured in the field, but computed from other variables that can be measured.This is only the total amount of timberland. Actual forest cover for each state may be significantly higher.
