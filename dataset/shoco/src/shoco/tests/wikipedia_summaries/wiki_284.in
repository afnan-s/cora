Johann II (German: Johann Maria Franz Placidus; 5 October 1840 â€“ 11 February 1929), also known as Johann II the Good (Johann II der Gute), was the Prince of Liechtenstein between 1858 and 1929. His reign of 70 years and 91 days is the third-longest of any monarch in European history, after those of King Louis XIV and Queen Elizabeth II (in that order), and fourth-longest overall (for which exact dates are known) after King Louis XIV, Queen Elizabeth II, and King Bhumibol Adulyadej (in that order).
