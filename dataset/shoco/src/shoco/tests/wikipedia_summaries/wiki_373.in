This is a list of New Zealand places named by James Cook. Cook was the first European navigator to circumnavigate and chart the archipelago. He chose names from dull to droll to descriptive, from metaphorical to a narrative of events, or to honour people and to record the existing MƒÅori language names of places. The list below is in the order described in Cook's journals of his first and second voyages to the Pacific.
