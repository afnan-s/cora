The Scandinavian egg, also known as the Quisling egg, is an enamelled Easter egg made by Michael Perchin under the supervision of the Russian jeweller Peter Carl Fabergé between 1899 and 1903. The egg was made for a St. Petersburg client, one of the very few Fabergé eggs that were not made for the Russian Imperial Family.
