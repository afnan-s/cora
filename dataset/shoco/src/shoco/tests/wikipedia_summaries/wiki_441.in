Whateley Hall (not to be confused with Whately Hall in Banbury) was a stately home in the Warwickshire countryside near Castle Bromwich.
The house was owned by the owners of Barrells Hall, the Newtons of Glencripesdale Estate. A housing estate was built on the house and grounds in 1935 when it was demolished
