Line M1, officially referred to as the M1 Yenikapı–Atatürk Airport/Kirazlı metro line (Turkish: M1 Yenikapı–Atatürk Havalimanı/Kirazlı metro hattı), also known as the Istanbul Light Metro (Turkish: Hafif Metro), is a rapid transit line of the Istanbul Metro. Opened in 1989, it was the first rapid transit line in Istanbul and Turkey and its opening started the revival of mass-transit in Turkish cities.
The M1 consists of two train services, M1A and M1B. Both services run on the same line from Yenikapı to Otogar, where the M1B branches off to Kirazlı, while the M1A continues on the original line to Istanbul Atatürk Airport. The M1 has 23 stations in service, of which 11 are underground and 3 elevated, and the total length of the line is 26.8 kilometers (16.7 mi). Even though the M1 is fully grade separated, it is considered a light metro line, due to the relatively low passenger capacity compared to other lines of the system.
In November 2014, the long-awaited extension from Aksaray to Yenikapı was opened.
