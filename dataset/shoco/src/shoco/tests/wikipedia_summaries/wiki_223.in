Symptoms is the seventh full-length studio album by Israeli punk band Useless ID. It was released on February 14, 2012, and is the band's first album on Fat Wreck Chords. It was released almost 4 years after the band's previous album, The Lost Broken Bones, marking the longest gap between two Useless ID albums, although the band released a collaboration album with rapper Muki in 2010.
It is the third album the band recorded at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with producers Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore, and the band's last album with drummer Jonathan Harpak, who left the band shortly after the release.
