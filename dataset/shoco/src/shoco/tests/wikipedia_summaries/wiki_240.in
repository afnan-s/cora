The Harrisburg Line is a rail line owned and operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The line runs from Philadelphia west to Harrisburg. 
The Harrisburg Line was formed the day Conrail began operations, April 1, 1976, from two former Reading Company lines, the original namesake main line to Reading, Pennsylvania, and the Lebanon Valley Branch.
Today, the Harrisburg Line is owned by Norfolk Southern Railway under their Harrisburg Division. The Harrisburg Line runs through two tunnels, the Flat Rock Tunnel in Lower Merion Township and the Black Rock Tunnel in Phoenixville.
