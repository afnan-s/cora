Japan Relief is an archival live album release by the American rock band Phish. The show was recorded on July 31, 1999 during one of Phish's performances at that year's Fuji Rock Festival at the Naeba Ski Resort in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. All proceeds from this show were sent to the Peace Winds America and their Japanese relief program, Peace Winds Japan, following the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The show was later made available through Phish's LivePhish website in limited CD format as well as through MP3 and lossless download format.The Fuji Rock Festival marked the first time Phish would play in Japan. Phish archivist said about the show "The July 31st show crackled with energy, intermingling classic and new material with an exploratory vibe that meshed with the atmosphere of respect and beauty." The show features tibetan musician, Nawang Khechog, who spoke about Tibetan human rights before performing on Universal Horn/Vacuum Jam and Brian And Robert playing tibetan horn and wood flute.
