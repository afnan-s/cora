The First Congress of Lithuanian Women (Lithuanian: Pirmasis lietuvių moterų suvažiavimas) took place on 6–7 October [O.S. 23–24 September] 1907 in Kaunas (then part of the Russian Empire, now Lithuania). It was organized by Catholic priests in preparation for the October 1907 election to the third State Duma but discussed only cultural and economic issues. The organizers attempted to invite representatives of different social classes and political affiliations leading to disagreements between socialists and Catholic clergy, and between educated intellectuals and less educated villagers. The congress resolved to establish the Lithuanian Women's Union. However, disagreements between the liberals and the Catholics led to splintering of the women's movement and to the establishment of the Association of Lithuanian Catholic Women in January 1908. The Women's Union was officially established only in 1922.
