The Butterfield Cobblestone House is on Bennett Corners Road in the Town of Clarendon, New York, United States, south of the village of Holley. It is a cobblestone structure from the mid-19th century built in the Greek Revival architectural style by a wealthy local farmer to house his large family. Three generations of his descendants would run the farm over the next 80 years. Later owners would make some renovations to the interior.
One of approximately 90 cobblestone structures in Orleans County, it is the only one in Clarendon. It is also considered the finest Greek Revival building in the county. The house and several outbuildings, part of a working farm, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010, the easternmost property in the county currently so recognized.
