The 2015 Minnesota Twins season  was the 55th season for the franchise in the Twin Cities of Minnesota, their sixth season at Target Field and the 115th overall in the American League. The team finished second in the AL Central with an 83–79 record, their best overall result since the 2010 season, which was the last year they made the playoffs.  The team remained in the running for a wild card berth in the American League playoffs until losing Game 161 (their second to last).  They would eventually win a wild card berth two years later, in 2017. In between, however, the team lost 103 games.
After seven years away, outfielder Torii Hunter returned for his twelfth year as a Twin.  Lauded rookies Eddie Rosario, Miguel Sano and Byron Buxton arrived from the minors; each tallied their first big-league hit, home run and run batted in.  In Rosario's case, he did all three on May 6 on the first big-league pitch he saw, just the twenty-ninth player in history to do so. In May, the Twins had a month record of 20-7, which was the best month for the franchise since June 1991, the last year they won the World Series.

== Season summary ==
New manager Paul Molitor oversaw a winning season (83-79) for his Minnesota club, following four consecutive seasons of 90 or more losses under previous manager Ron Gardenhire.
2.22 million fans attended Twins games at Target Field, the ninth highest total in the American League.
The season brought some "Twins' firsts" and broke or matched several longstanding club records:
Facing Detroit, the Twins began the season with 24.1 scoreless innings, a club record in futility. Paul Molitor didn't get his first win until the fourth game. Among Twins managers, only Billy Martin in 1969 waited longer for his first victory.
On May 6, rookie outfielder Eddie Rosario hit a Target Field home run on the first major league pitch he saw, something no other Twin has done.
On June 14, three Twins hit triples in the sixth inning, a Twins first. Oddly, the Twins only scored one run in the inning. With another triple two innings earlier, the power burst added up to the club's first four-triple game since 1964. All four three-baggers were hit off Texas Rangers' starter Nick Martinez.
In the week prior to All-Star Game, second baseman Brian Dozier belted two walk-off home runs, the first time a Twin has done that within one week. Dozier was a late addition to the American League All-Star roster as an injury replacement.
Relief pitcher Glen Perkins set club records with 28 consecutive saves to start the season.
Rookie Miguel Sano was called up, and blasted ten home runs in his first 41 games—the fastest start for any Twins or Washington Senators rookie.
Eddie Rosario set a Twins rookie record by tallying fifteen triples (which led the major leagues) and tied the late Kirby Puckett's 1984 rookie club record with sixteen outfield assists.
On September 24, first baseman Joe Mauer reached base safely in his 43rd straight game, setting a Minnesota record.  The record had been held by Harmon Killebrew at 40 in 1970.
Two days later, third baseman Trevor Plouffe grounded into his major-league-leading 28th double play.  The tally tied Harmon Killebrew, in the 1970 season, for the Minnesota record.
On Oct. 1, Brian Dozier struck out for the 146th time this season.  His season finished with 148 strikeouts, topping the previous club record of 145, set by Bobby Darwin in 1972.Two Twins made the All-Star Game: relief pitcher Glen Perkins and second baseman Brian Dozier. In the eighth inning, Dozier pinch hit and homered off Mark Melancon in his only at-bat in Cincinnati's Great American Ball Park. Perkins pitched the ninth inning in the AL's 6-3 win.
Pitchers Phil Hughes and Kyle Gibson each finished with eleven wins for tops in the Win column. No pitcher lost more than eleven games. Eight Twins finished with ten or more homers.
