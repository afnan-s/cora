Saint Peter became the bishop of Antioch and led the church there. 
Evodius was one of the 72 disciples of Christ. He eventually succeeded Peter as bishop of Antioch when Peter left for Rome.Saint Evodius was bishop of Antioch until 66 AD, and was succeeded by Saint Ignatius of Antioch. Catholic tradition says it is likely that Saint Evodius died of natural causes, however, the Eastern Orthodox tradition holds that he was martyred under Emperor Nero in 66 AD. As one of the first pagans to come to the new church, he is venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church, as well as the Assyrian Church of the East. His feast day is 6 May in the Catholic Church and 7 September in the Eastern Orthodox Church.
It has been claimed that in one of his many writings, Evodius asserts that the Virgin Mary gave birth to Jesus Christ, the Saviour, when she was fifteen. However, no known writings of Evodius survive today.
