The 1920 Kyiv Victory Parade was a joint Polish–Ukrainian military parade on 9 May 1920 in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. It was held on Khreshchatyk Street, after the city was captured from the Bolshevik Red Army by the allied forces of Poland and the Ukrainian People's Republic in the course of their Kyiv Offensive. It was the first formal military parade to be held under the auspices of the Ukrainian People's Republic.

On the morning of 9 May, to the accompaniment of cannon fire from the Darnytskyi District, which marked the beginning of the military procession. Although originally, the parade was to be presided by Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski and Supreme Commander of the Ukrainian Army Chief Otaman Symon Petliura, certain plans for the two forced this not to happen, with the parade being commanded bu General Edward Rydz-Śmigły (representing the Polish 3rd Cavalry Corps) and Colonel Marko Bezruchko (the commander of the 6th Ukrainian Infantry Division). Among other officials in attendance were representatives of the directorate of the chief of staff of the Polish Army as well as attaches from France and Japan.The procession was as follows:
1st Legions Infantry Division
15th "Greater Poland" Infantry Division

6th Ukrainian Infantry Division

Many Kyivans greeted Polish liberators with flowers and loud shouts of Slava! (Glory). Following the ceremonial parade, all Polish forces in Kyiv were withdrawn, to which control was given to the Ukrainian 6th division under the control of Petliura and the Directorate of Ukraine.

Today, the parade is often overshadowed against the backdrop of the Victory Day over Nazism in World War II holiday and the Victory Day Parades held on that day. On the 100th anniversary of the parade in 2020, Ukrainian and Polish journalists toured the parade route. Initially, before the COVID-19 pandemic, it was planned that the capital would host large celebrations to mark the centenary. Polish President Andrzej Duda  addressed the idea of commemorating the parade with President Volodymyr Zelensky during the latter's visit to Auschwitz. Among others, there has also been petitions to replace the traditional 9 May holiday celebration with a commemoration of the parade, in an effort to break with the Russian holiday schedule and reduce the Russification of Ukraine.
