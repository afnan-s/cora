The two exchanged words, and Kovalyov ended up leaving the venue forfeiting the game. Kovalyov had been wearing shorts to FIDE events for years, but no one had said anything to him before about it. Kovalyov said part of his anger came from Azmaiparashvili shouting that he was dressed like a 'gypsy,' a word that struck Kovalyov as a racial slur.
