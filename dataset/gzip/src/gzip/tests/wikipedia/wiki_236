Kiwa is an electronic music live act from Finland by Markku Louhio (Mark Nomen). Original members also included Matti Elsinen (DJ Mauzer). Since 2016 Markku has continued the project as a solo artist.Markku and Matti began their musical careers as producers in the psychedelic trance scene in 1995. The group started to make a name for themselves performing in underground raves and forest parties in the late 1990s. After their first releases on the Helsinki-based label Surreal Audio Recordings in 2000 and 2001, Kiwa started to gain followers also internationally. The music of Kiwa has influences among other styles from funk, breaks, house and drum 'n' bass. [1] Kiwa's first two albums, Dreamtime Enhancer (2002) [2] and Retroactive (2004) [3], represent a style blending mix of psy trance, breaks, electronica and occasional references to drum and bass. Kiwa's third album On the Frequency (2007) [4] shows a more progressive approach on dance music.
Markku Louhio is also known for his other projects Headphonics, Highpersonic Whomen, Omen Sisters and The Faithealers.
