Dearraindrop is an artist collective based in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Dearraindrop incorporates diverse disciplines that work together to create multifaceted sculptures and installations. Part of the collective's operating philosophy is modeled on the idea that our greatest human capability is the ability to work together to achieve a greater goal. DEARRAINDROP's work incorporates painting, collage, video, large-scale, interactive installation pieces, and hand-fabricated musical instruments.
Joe Grillo and Laura Grant founded DEARRAINDROP in 1998 as a clothing line. The collective is currently composed of three artists: Joe Grillo, Laura Grant, and  Billy Grant. In the past, Dearraindrop has worked with a digital electrician Owen Osborn  Chris Kuscinski and painter Alika Herreshoff.
In 2010 Joe Grillo and Laura Grant moved their studio to Brooklyn, New York, and are producing work for upcoming exhibitions in Los Angeles, New York, and Norway.
