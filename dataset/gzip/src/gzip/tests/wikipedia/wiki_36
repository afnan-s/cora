Indian Ethos in Management refers to the values and practices that the culture of India (Bharatheeya Sanskriti) can contribute to service, leadership and management. These values and practices are rooted in Sanathana Dharma (the eternal essence), and have been influenced by various strands of Indian philosophy.

2. Atmanomokshartham Jagat Hitayacha - Endeavors should be made considering the well-being of the world too, while considering the (spiritual) well-being of oneself.
3. Trikaranasuddhi - To consider work as a means to grow oneself in 'Purity and Unity of Thought, Word and Deed'.4. Yagnaya charatha: karma - To engage in work as a sacred offering
