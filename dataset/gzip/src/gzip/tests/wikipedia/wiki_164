A standard gauge branch line from the New South Wales Government Railways Main South line at The Rock was extended from Lockhart to Oaklands in 1912.A broad gauge branch line from the Victorian Railways North East line at Benalla was extended from Yarrawonga to Oaklands in 1938, creating a break-of-gauge until the New South Wales line was closed south of Boree Creek. There are several stations between Yarrawonga and Oaklands.With the conversion of the North East railway to Albury to standard gauge in 2008, the Oaklands branch railway was for a time a gauge orphan.
