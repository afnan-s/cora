Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 56 kDa regulatory subunit alpha isoform is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PPP2R5A gene.


== Function ==
The product of this gene belongs to the phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B family. Protein phosphatase 2A is one of the four major Ser/Thr phosphatases, and it is implicated in the negative control of cell growth and division. It consists of a common heteromeric core enzyme, which is composed of a catalytic subunit and a constant regulatory subunit, that associates with a variety of regulatory subunits. The B regulatory subunit might modulate substrate selectivity and catalytic activity. This gene encodes an alpha isoform of the regulatory subunit B56 subfamily.


== Interactions ==
PPP2R5A has been shown to interact with:

AXIN1,
CTLA-4,
PPP2CA,
PPP2R1A,
PPP2R1B, and
PPP2R5C
