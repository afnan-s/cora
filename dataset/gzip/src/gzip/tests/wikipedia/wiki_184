Nena Live, released on 16 November 1998, is a live recording by German pop singer Nena. It features a show performed at the Rheinstadion in DÃ¼sseldorf on 21 August 1998 (the last track, Pur's "Lena", here rendered as "Nena", was recorded the following evening). This is Nena's second live album and should be distinguished from the 1995 release of the same title.
