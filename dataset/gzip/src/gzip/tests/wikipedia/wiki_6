Oorja Fuel Cells is working with market leaders around the world such as Toyota Tsusho, Baldor, and US Foods.

Toyota TsushoOorja has partnered with Toyota Tsusho in pursuit of wide commercial adoption of affordable fuel cells to help solve energy and transportation challenges in Japan. As methanol fuel cells cost less than hydrogen batteries because methanol is easier to transport and handle than hydrogen, this will hope to cut down on energy costs in Toyota's home nation of Japan.

== Products ==
The company’s OorjaPac fuel cell product operates as an on-board battery charger for material handling vehicles. OorjaPac features on-board sensors that keep the vehicle's battery at a constant state of charge, eliminating the need for battery swapping and rapid charging.
The OorjaPac Model 1 provides 5 kW output, as much as 50 times more power to on-board batteries than other fuel cells, the Model 1 could extend the range of electric vehicles like General Motors’ Chevy Volt or Nissan’s Leaf by two to three times.The OorjaPac Model 3 is similar to the Model 1, but it provides 1.5 kW output.The OorjaPac Model T is a liquid fuel cell that is tailored to meet the needs of the telecommunication industry.Oorja Protonics also offers the OorjaRig™, a refueling system that stores and delivers methanol to the OorjaPac™ on-board charging system that is designed for indoor use in commercial and industrial environments.
