== Format ==
Big Brother VIP is a game show in which a group of celebrity contestants, referred to as housemates, live in isolation from the outside world in a custom built "house", constantly under video surveillance. Access to television, the Internet, print media, and time is prohibited. In addition, the housemates live in complete confinement; they have no access to the outside world. Sometimes the viewers votes for their favorite housemates, and the housemates with the most votes had immunity. Also sometimes the housemates votes for their favorite housemate of house, and the housemate with the most votes had immunity. At least once a week, the housemates secretly nominate two housemates they wish to face a public vote to evict. The two or more housemates with the most votes face the public vote. The viewing public decides which of them gets evicted through text message votes or phone calls. The nominee with the most votes is evicted and leaves the house. Should their stay inside the house become difficult for them to bear, a housemate is allowed to voluntarily leave at any time during the game. In the event of a withdrawal from the house, a replacement housemate usually enters in their place. In the final week of each season, the viewers vote for which of the remaining people in the house should win the prize money of €100,000 and be crowned the winner of Big Brother VIP.
During their time in the house, housemates are given weekly tasks to perform. The housemates wager a portion of their weekly shopping budget on the task, and either win double their wagered fund or lose the wagered fund depending on their performance in the task. The housemates are required to work as a group to complete their tasks, with the format of the tasks varying based on the number of remaining housemates. The housemates are forbidden from discussing nominations, and doing so could result in punishment. The format of the series is mainly seen as a social experiment, and requires housemates to interact with others who may have differing ideals, beliefs, and prejudices. Housemates are also required to make visits to the diary room during their stay in the house, where they are able to share their thoughts and feelings on their fellow housemates and the game.
A new twist to change the format of the game was featured, this was the Pandora's Box. The twist sees a housemate being tempted by the box, and can choose to either open the box or leave it. Should a Housemate choose to open Pandora's Box, both good and bad consequences could be unleashed into the house, which impacts every Housemate in-game including the person who opens it. Another twist was the Power of Veto, like in the American format, a housemate can win the Power of Veto. The winner of the Veto competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated housemates or leave them as is.


== House ==
The house of Big Brother is always one of the most discussed topics in Albania before the according season starts. In the original version, the location of the house was always in different locations, like Gërdec and Kashar.
