== Reception ==
Hemanth Kumar writing for Firstpost rated the film 1 out of five, and criticised film's poor writing. "Kunal Kohli’s writing has the same annoying after effect of a tuning fork that’s thrusted into your ears. The problem isn’t with how ‘talkative’ everyone is, but it’s more about what the film wants to say and how much it wants to say within two hours of its runtime," Kumar added. India Today critic Janani K, rated 1.5/5 and stated, "Bollywood director Kunal Kohli's debut Telugu film Next Enti tries to be a contemporary new age rom-com, but falls flat on its face." Neeshitha Nyayapati of The Times of India also rated 1.5 of 5, writing, "The conversations seem forced, so do most of the scenes. The character developments are so inconsistent that when they finally flesh out in the second half, it almost makes one wish they go back to being the flat cardboards they were in the first half."
