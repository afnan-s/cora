The Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova (Romanian: Partidul Liberal Democrat din Moldova, PLDM) is a conservative political party in Moldova. The party is led by Tudor Deliu. Until 2016, PLDM was led by Vlad Filat, who was Prime Minister of Moldova from 2009 to 2013, in two cabinets. Immediately after the 2014 parliamentary elections, with 21 seats in the Moldovan Parliament, PLDM was the largest of the three democratic pro-European parliamentary parties.
The party's founding congress was held on 8 December 2007 and Vlad Filat was elected as president. The initiative group of the party was centered on Filat, who had previously been a prominent member of the Democratic Party of Moldova (PDM), who was disappointed with the direction taken by that political party under Dumitru Diacov's leadership. Soon, many local branches of the Christian Democratic Popular Party (PPCD), disappointed with Iurie Roşca's policy of cooperation with the Communist Party of Moldova (PCRM), joined PLDM en masse. The party also attracted many of prominent members of civil society.
At its first election, in April 2009, PLDM won 15 seats, which increased to 18 three months later, after which Filat became the Prime Minister, leading the Alliance for European Integration (AIE). In November 2010, the PLDM jumped to 32 seats, becoming the dominant non-Communist party. The AIE was replaced by the Pro-European Coalition in 2013, when Iurie Leancă replaced Filat as Prime Minister, with Filat remaining as the party chairman.
