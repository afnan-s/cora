Sanistand was a female urinal manufactured by Japanese toilet maker giant TOTO from 1951 to 1971 and marketed by American Standard from 1950 to 1973. It appeared in a bathroom in the National Stadium for female athletes during the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The urinal encouraged women to urinate from a standing position, without the need to sit on a shared seat.
