At The Movies is the ninth album from jazz vocalist Gary Williams. Recorded at Kenilworth Studios in 2017, the album was originally intended to feature only Disney songs but was later expanded to cover songs from the movies. It was recorded with full big band and a jazz combo.
The London Evening Standard awarded the album four stars saying, "This selection of movie tunes sung with Sinatra-esque flair, will transport you down memory lane and get your serotonin levels soaring."Musical Theatre Review said, "He has such a beautiful voice – just like black velvet and, although the style is not completely to my liking (jazz-orientated) there is something about his voice that is completely mesmerising."New York's Cabaret Scene's magazine said, "This is one of those perfect, easy-listening albums, excellent for relaxing to after a day at work, or serving as background music at a dinner party."
