The Armenian Declaration of Independence (Armenian: Հայաստանի Անկախության Հռչակագիր) is the declaration of independence of the Armenian provinces from the Russian Empire. Armenia was proclaimed independent in Tiflis on 28 May 1918.
Declaration 
In view of the complete political collapse of the Trans-Caucasus and the new situation created by the proclamation of the independence of Georgia and Azerbaijan, the Armenian National Council declares itself the supreme and sole administration of the Armenian provinces. Due to certain grave circumstances that prevent us from forming an Armenian National Government, the Armenian National Council temporarily assumes all governmental functions in order to pilot the political and administrative leadership of the Armenian provinces.
