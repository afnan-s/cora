Love's Lines, Angles and Rhymes is the sixth album by American pop group The 5th Dimension, released in 1971. The title song had been recorded originally by Diana Ross the previous year.  It reached #17 on Billboard's Top 200 Album Chart and became the band's third consecutive album to be certified Gold.
Following the success of "One Less Bell to Answer" featuring Marilyn McCoo as lead vocalist, she was once again chosen to take the reins for the first single from the album.  The record, after which the album was named, became another Top 20 hit for The 5th.  The follow-up single, "Light Sings", fared less well, just missing the Top 40.  No other singles were issued from this album, as Bell Records decided to prepare for the group's first 'live' album release instead.
